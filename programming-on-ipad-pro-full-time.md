# Programming on iPad Pro full-time

_Excerpt._

## My Workflow

### Blink, Mosh, DigitalOcean & Docker-project-manager

Docker-project-manager

### Remotix, mouse, RDP & remote Windows in Azure

    "Hey man, the app is ready! It works great on mobile Safari on my iPad!"

It's crystal clear that as a professional web developer, I have to test on desktop browsers as well. Therefore, having access to a desktop OS is imperative.

And there's another thing: doing JS development without Chrome development tools is quite impossible.

Azure is the only service I pay for that I didn't pay for before. And it's costly: to have a decently fast Windows machine, I pay XXX monthly.

But ... I don't have to carry a notebook around. No one can steal it, and I will never need to buy a "new version": the cost of HW upgrades is not on me.

You might have noticed that the title talks about iPad Pro 12.9", while I said I bought iPad Pro 10.5".

As much as prefer the smaller one, testing a web app in such a small resolution simply is not an option. It's just too small. So I got the large iPad Pro and I use the small one as my personal device.
