# About

Data for [botanicus.me](http://botanicus.me) using my [blog engine](https://github.com/botanicus/blog).

Generated data is in the [content branch](https://github.com/botanicus/data.blog/tree/content).

# Workflow

## Create a file in the `posts/` directory

- The name is `posts/article-slug/article-slug.md`.
- Any images and related files are in the `posts/article-slug` directory.
- The only `# Header` is name of the article.
- The first paragraph is the excerpt.
- All the `## Header`'s are the main titles and so on.

## Automatic conversions
- The base directory name gets timestamped `posts/20190518-article-slug`.
