# Sentido sobre metas

_It's this time of the year again, when people start their mental masturbation
with planning their new year's resolutions, only to break half of them the first day with the hangover of the new year's celebrations._

If there's a deep-enough intrinsic meaning in a project I'm doing, there's no need for me to have goals. I don't say _"my goal is to finish this project by XYZ"_, because if the project is (one of the _very_ few) important projects I have going on, I will remember.

On the other hand if I don't remember it, it's probably not worth doing. And this is where we mostly use goals. For instance: _"This year I will reach conversation level in French."_

If it's important enough, for instance we just moved to France and there's no way around it but to learn the language, what's the point of reminding us? We'll get there, if we're just a little bit mindful in our day to day life.

If it's just a wishful thinking, as these goals usually are, as in _it'd be cool to speak French, but I don't really need it_, then it's a waste of time being fixated at it.

**It's our inability to let life flow and trying to force an outcome we want.** Trying to play God.

Yes, you can, and you can really force yourself to learn the damn French, even if you're barely ever going to use it, by why on Earth would you?

_Just flow._

Happy New Year!
