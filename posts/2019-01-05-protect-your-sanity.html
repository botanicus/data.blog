  As I'm writing this, I'm sitting in a bus in south Mexico. It's time for some diving.
</p>

<p>
  I have about 2 hours. Time I intent to spend by writing.
</p>

<p>
  That's all good, the only thing is there's some really annoying movie on.
  Even as I'm trying not to look at the screen, it's impossible to tune it
  out for the loud voices and shooting in the movie.
</p>

<p>
  Or at least that's how would it be if I wouldn't be ready.
  I reach into my bag for my sound canceling headphones.
  I play some music for concentration and it's all good.
  Now I can get to work.
</p>

<p>
  This is nothing extraordinary by itself. As I was reflecting on the past year though,
  I realised I became very calm and focused like I have never been before.
  And when I say focused, I mean focused without really trying.
</p>

<p>
  While I believe meditation is the main ingredient to this, there are environmental things
  that you can make to work in your favour or against it and are quick to do.

<h1>Tune out the buzz</h1>
<p>
  <!-- No FB app, block FB in Safari, leave it only on my phone that is so crapy I don't want to use it and only web. -->
</p>

<!-- No TV -->
<!-- No ads, they are here to bring out the need, often by attackingg insecurities. -->

<h1>Silence the noise</h1>
<p>
  Noise canceling headphones
  Have ready your music! (offline)
  (without lyrics)
</p>

<h1>Disconnect to connect</h1>

<h1>Protect your sleep</h1>
blue light kills melatonin
iOS and macOS sets the tone
DND, preferably offline

<h1>Protect your mornings</h1>
