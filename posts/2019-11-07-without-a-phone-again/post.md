# Without a phone ... again

_Phones don't seem to be overly fond of me. So after an incident involving sea water, which rendered my phone unusable, I decided I wouldn't bother buying a new phone. One month in an I don't miss the bloody thing._

I like to swim in the sea. Turns out that my phone doesn't. I had it in a case that was waterproof â€“ or so I thought. It was a very cheap Huawei, so whatever.

Being under the impression that I "need" a phone, I started to investigate what are my options. I always buy cheap phones, but given my taste for Apple products, I decided I'd take a peak.

I wen to an Apple Store, and quite frankly, I was not impressed by what I saw even the slightest bit. So let me get it out of the way:

_Dear Apple, if you think I lost my mind to pay money that would buy me a new notebook for a thing that serves to send texts (which I never do), make calls (which I never do), read maps and be available on WhatsApp and Messenger, then I assure you I have not._

_Great that it's got 50 cameras and it can send messages to Mars, and one can use it to splash his toilet if he's so lazy to reach for the [thing], I just don't care._

And since I'm well going with my rant, what's the deal with these big phones? Steve Jobs used to laugh at the idea and I was always of the same belief.

_I don't want a bloody brick in my pocket._

Well, never mind then. I have 2 iPads: 1 for work, that very rarely leaves my home and 1 that I use for my personal matters, reading, blogging, talking to my friends and family, that sort of stuff.

For a long time I found having an iPad and a phone redundant. (!!!! wording)

You could argue that you can read on your phone etc, so why not go with the phone. 2 reasons: attached keyboard and Apple Pencil.

## Issues: no celular connectivity

I really wish I would have bought the celular version of the iPad. This would 

## Issues: using it on the street

I admit that an iPad is not the most convenient device to read a map. Does it matter? I still use it like that. And my navigation sense improved a lot, because in effect, I'm more mindful of the route, because it's a hassle trying to navigate with an iPad.

Seriously, we don't even realize how much we are outsourcing our brain activity to a phone. My friend ... navigation ... I knew casi always WTF.

## Issues: am I supposed to take it to a bar, just so I can order Uber?

Alcohol & expensive device.
Don't got to bars.
