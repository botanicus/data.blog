# Start from zero

_In my last post [meaning over goals](/posts/meaning-over-goals) I suggested goals are meaningless and that we should just flow. This is by no means intuitive. Let's dig into how to do just that._

It's so easy to be distracted these days. Work, traffic, hobbies, kids, social networks, email, never in history there have been so many information around.

When is the last time someone _really listened_ to you? Seeing groups of people having lunch, all of them on their phone, this simple skill is becoming scarce.

And since _being there with someone_, giving your full attention, _giving our companion_ is one of the most valuable things in life, this should give you an idea in how terrible shape our society is these days.

It's commonplace seeing parents with their kids, parents sucked into their screens and kids as well. What a childhood are these poor kids having.

Anyway, just as too much information is distractive to our relationships, it's distractive to our accomplishments. And this is where goals come from: it's a way of striving in an _autopilot age_.

But it's grossly mislead and goals are just not the way to go, as I said in my last post [meaning over goals](/posts/meaning-over-goals).

I finished the article saying that we should _just flow_ â€“ but how?

## Clear your plate first

If you ate so much cake you're sick, maybe ... eat less cake?

What matters to you in your life? Sure, reading FB can be fun, but then are you having time doing the things that you really want to do, that are important to you, what you want to be your contribution to the humanity?

It's easy to say _"oh, I'm just reading FB now, but I'll get to it in a bit"_. Of course no one believes that.

Are you gonna make yourself useful or what?

I strongly recommend you adhering to your own version of [digital minimalism](/posts/digital-minimalism), removing all the distractions, so you can concentrate on what matters.

I even [ditched FB](/posts/bye-bye-facebook) and I don't regret it, in fact I'd definitely recommend it, but of course that might be too much for many people.

## Taking care of yourself <i class="hashtag">meditation</i> <i class="hashtag">exercise</i>

Goals and deadlines have the advantage that they work to a decent degree even on autopilot. The flow state, when things just happen and we don't even know how, is much more enjoyable, but it's a lot more fragile.

First of all, _keep watching where are you wasting your time_ and remove it from your life. Delete the app, block the website, do what you have to do to make it go away.

Second, how do you take care of your body and mind? I say body and mind, because they are connected. If you're not _meditating_ yet, I suggest you start! _Exercise_, in whatever form you find enjoyable, at least on a semi-regular basis is also important.

## Time allocation

Since you removed all the distractions, now it shouldn't be so hard to implement the right schedule to allow you to flow.

This shouldn't be anything too rigid and certainly shouldn't be forced, as flow works, because we want to do something. If you don't feel like doing it today, give it a miss. If you don't feel like doing it ever, well, do you really have to do it?
