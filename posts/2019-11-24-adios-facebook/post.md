# Adios Facebook

_What's the point for an unsocial person to have a social media account? I just deleted my Facebook as well as Twitter account._

I kept Facebook only as an address book and a messaging platform. But I don't care to be in touch with _many_ people anyways. I have some good friends and that's good enough for me.

I don't care to hear what I might be "missing on". I'm not missing on anything. I have my peace of mind and that's all I need.

## So now what?

I'm trying to use email for now. Telegram also looks good and since the team behind it seems to have some morals, unlike big Mark, I'm going to give it a go as well.

My Telegram is [@jakubstastny](https://t.me/jakubstastny).

## And for a contact book?

I like to synchronise my contacts to Gmail. That means I have all my contacts available and I'm not necessarily locked into Apple solutions.

Fortunately on iPadOS this is very easy to do:
