# CÃ³mo aprendo idiomas

_I was always appalled and bored to death at the same time by the way languages are being taught in school. There is no wonder that many people cannot use language they spent years learning in a school. But as much as learning language is always hard, if you do it smart, you can be fluent in a few months._

I moved to London when I was 19. My English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ was horrible and my ears were barely able to identify the East London working class accent as an actual words being spoken.

I managed to get work, but it was due to my technical ability: I understood maybe 2/3 of the questions at the interview.

This is to say I don't consider myself having any special talents when it comes to learn languages.

But over the years, I added Spanish ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ and Polish ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± to my repertoire and was able to get by in Italy and Russia to understand in most daily situations and even to have some conversations.

I've seen a lot of people who are good in learning languages, but I've seen also a lot of people struggling.

Why is that? I believe it's the approach. Let me elaborate.

## Be realistic

Firstly, learning a language is one of the largest projects you can take on in your life, if you want to be really good in that language.

If you don't have proper motivation, you are unlikely to get very far.

Also decide on what your goal is.

If you just want to be able to get by in daily life, in situations like restaurants, you will be able to learn that in few short weeks or even days.

But if you want to be actually able to have conversations about life with people, well, that's gonna take much more effort than that.

## Immerse yourself in the language

Change your phone, computer to the language you're learning. Find a TV show in that language. Listen to music in that language. And most importantly _hang out with people who are using that language_ as well as with _other people learning the language_. Language exchanges (intercambio) are also good.

As you progress, you'll be able to immerse deeper.

It took me a while, before I was able to switch Google search to Spanish (and hence, getting Wikipedia articles in Spanish, which was very difficult for me to read in the beginning).

It's a bit of a catch-22. You need to be able to get some minimal understanding of the language to be really able to learn.

_Again, I recommend you to consider your goals. It might be really helpful to have as your first goal to be able to get by in say cafÃ©, restaurants, asking directions, that sort
of things â€“ that is, as long as you actually use these things, say you're on holidays. Don't learn theoretical bullshit from textbooks, if you don't use it, it's pointless and a waste of time. Have the goal of conversational fluence as your next goal â€“ it might be too big of a chunk to chew on in the beginning._

## Learn the vocabulary you hear, not anyone else's

Forget Duolingo, forget "word of the day into your inbox" and all that rubbish.

Well, unless you want to be able to name every damn animal in a ZOO. In that case, _Â¡adelante!_

I cannot stress this point enough.

You need to be part of conversations in a language (even as an observer, even if it's just a TV show in that language), but these have to be *real conversations* and I'd recommend starting with *spoken*, not written ones. Aka don't buy a book to start with. It will be harder, won't give you the vocabulary you need, will confuse you with more difficult grammar and won't increase your fluency. Do read books in that language once you're able to make conversations without resorting back to English.

## Collect the vocabulary

_You're in a bar in shady part of BogotÃ¡. It's getting late and your brain actually hurts from trying to speak Spanish all day._

_You're talking to a woman you met on a plane from Mexico City. Es peruana. It just happened to be her birthday._

_"Â¿Pues te gustÃ³ MÃ©xico?"_

_"SÃ­, mucho. Solo que los chilangos usan mucha jerga, a veces me cuesta entender."_

What the hell is *jerga*?

For a long time, I used to have a paper notebook on me at most times and write down things there.

These days I got more lazy and I often look for a word in a dictionary, then I take a screenshot and I will review all the screenshots later.

Whatever method you use, it must fulfill two objectives: to **capture new words** and, equally important, **not to cut the conversation**.

_When it comes to active learning, this is the single most important method you can use. There is nothing that keeps moving you towards fluency and beyond than **learning the vocabulary you encounter in your life**. There is nothing more real than that._

What do you do with the vocabulary you captured afterwards is up to you. Paper flashcards? Electronic flashcards, such as Anki? Up to you. Anki has _spaced repetition_, but we remember more from what we've written by hand than what we've just typed on a computer.

## Refuse to speak English

_Do this once you're able to make a conversation. Don't wait too long to implement this one, even though it's going to be hard in the beginning._

Even better, if you are not a native English speaker, just say you don't speak English.

And I really recommend, that if it's plausible, say you're European, but not English or American, just say you don't speak it.

For whatever reason, many people seem to think they know better than you, so despite refusing to speak English, they'll still speak you in English. That is unless you can persuade them that you can't.

And that's it really. Immerse yourself, collect the vocabulary, refuse to speak English and you'll be talking the foreign language fluently enough in a few months. I speak from repeated experience.
