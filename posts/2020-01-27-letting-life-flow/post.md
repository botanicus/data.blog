# Letting life flow

_Dropping the idea that we're the creators of our destiny, Gods of our universe, is very counterintuitive, a heresy to our "yes, we can" culture. Yet this obsession with control is what makes us unhappy._

> A good traveler has no fixed plans, and is not intent on arriving.
– Lao Tzu

## The duality of being a creator vs being a subject

Let's use breathing as an example: you can force a certain pattern of breathing. You're the _creator_ of it. Yet, if you just forget about it, you breathe anyway. It's like breathing is just _happening to you_.

Life is exactly like that. We can go with Tony Robbins and all the other american "gurus" that just force everything in their life all the time. It is possible. But bloody hell, what a drain!

And most importantly ... if you're shouting all the time, then you can never listen. Are you sure you're the smartest kid on the block?

## Listen to who or what?

Life. God. Your soul. Other souls. There's a lot out there. Real wisdom. Not (just) some monkey brains.

Would I want to force my life, I'm sure I wouldn't be where I'm in now. I dropped out of high school, because it felt right. Consequently an opportunity came and I ended up in London. Would I be trying to force my education, I wouldn't get the opportunity or if I would, I wouldn't be able to take it.

## The illusion of control

OK, so say you do think you're the smartest kid on the block and you _a huevo_ decide to force your life the way you – as in you the monkey, as opposite to you God/your soul – want.

It works with some things, but if it's something that happens to be important for the soul, it sends us messages. Subtle at first, but if we're still not listening, an illness is a common way that we're forced to reevaluate our priorities.

It might sound like from some New Age blabbering, but ... it's just from life. It hasn't happened to me, but I know people to whom it did.

Maybe you've seen it in your life or in lives of others. From the ones who got some serious illness, and see their life in a bigger picture often come to change exactly in whatever was necessary they'd change.

My spiritual guide told me a story like that. She was successful in many things, built a successful company for instance, but she was meant to concentrate on helping people with her very impressive spiritual abilities. So she was getting distracted with everything else. But every time there came some setback. In business, in health. But she always got up and said to herself she can do it. And then she got cancer.

She recovered, gave up other pursuits and even though she's 72 now and a chain smoker, she's of a great health and very active. She's doing what she's meant to, flowing with life, fulfilling her mission.

## What bloody mission?

I believe that our soul has chosen a mission before we were born. The monkey is in control, but generally working on our mission is what gives us deep satisfaction, whereas the opposite often brings problems including illness.

## Control vs engagement

By no means I'm arguing for a fatalistic viewpoint _"why bother? it's out of my control anyway"_. No, not like that.

I came to the conclusion that life is like a movie, it just happens, no need to force it. So just **surrender and let it flow**.
