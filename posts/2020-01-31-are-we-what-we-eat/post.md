# Are we what we eat?

_For the past few months I've been trying to improve my health using <abbr title="Traditional Chinese medicine">TCM </abbr>. The changes were remarkable, so today I'm going to share what I found out._

For a long time I felt with little energy. Getting up in the morning was always a struggle and chores that I didn't want to do were "beyond my reach" and I'd often postpone them nearly indefinitely. That's not to say I was not productive at all: I was, as long as I could run with the _flow_.

You see, flow is more _yin_, feminine way. It runs without needing to spend much energy. Chores that you don't like require you to spend _yang_ energy. If you have it, great, but if you don't, you will have very hard time getting on with these tasks.

the first go
now

metabolism slowing down -> yin
if you're pale and live in a cold country, don't eat fresh veggies
spleen qi deficiency
graphs of heart rate
less phlegm
