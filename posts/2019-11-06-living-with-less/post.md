# Living with less

_Recently I was forced to introduce budget into my life. What I took as an annoyance and necessity ended up being a blessing in disguise that brought me more mental peace, stability and sense of direction in life._

I found myself in a situation when money is not an abundance, as I made a decision to prefer having more spare time (that I invest into my further education) over having more money.

For the most parts I always lived in a rather humble way: I never had an apartment for myself, cooked regularly and didn't buy much of anything as I don't like owning things.

Still, I had some habits that were rather costly. Eating out for instance. Going out to a good Japanese restaurant? Steak? Count me in!

Well, no more. In the process of trying to be realistic about what I can afford and what not, it became blatantly obvious that eating out is not going to be an option, with the exception of cheap street food (though – of a decent quality, I'm not a rubbish bin).

When I realized where I stand, it was a bit difficult getting used to it. But ... I kept aware that it's my decision to prefer my time (hence my further education), and that it's more important to me that blowing money in a restaurant.

So I came to accept the situation. I came up with a simple, [cash-only envelope system](/posts/my-cash-only-envelope-system) for managing my day-to-day expenses and that was it.

I saw it as a measure of necessity, but I came to really enjoy it. By no means I feel poor, despite the fact that my budget really is ridiculously low.

Things just seem to be falling in place in a way that I can even afford things with my budget don't sound like something I would be able to afford much.

I really wanted to try _temazcal_. I looked online and the prices were at around 500–700 pesos. That's too much for me. But then I remembered a friendly local woman who mentioned she does temazcal. I went to see her, and it turned out there's a local holistic center and they charge 100 for it.

There I met a very sympathetic woman. She said she's a massagist. My back has been aching, so I said _"oh, I could really use a massage"_. We exchanged contacts to discuss details later.

I talked to her the next day, and asked her about the massage and the price. Her price was out of my range, so I told her that _"unfortunately that is out of my budget"_.

I didn't try to bargain, but she asked me _"so how much can you contribute?"_. I gave her 1 paragraph overview of my situation, giving her my actual weekly budget, and said that given that, the best I can do is some 400 pesos. It was less than half of what she asked for.

She was so kind to agree to it. And here's the thing:

> If you know your budget and are honest about it, people are understanding. But this only works if you actually have a budget.

## Not being able to afford things

I thought I would find not being able to afford things and experiences annoying and sad.

With a great surprise I observed that the opposite is the truth. Yes, I do have less options. Thanks God for that!

No, seriously – I know it sounds very counterintuitive, but having more options doesn't make you any happier.

[Fear of missing out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out) has become such a thing, that it even has its own Wikipedia page. It says:

> Fear of missing out, or FOMO, is "a pervasive apprehension that others might be having rewarding experiences from which one is absent". This social anxiety is characterized by "a desire to stay continually connected with what others are doing". FOMO is also defined as a fear of regret, which may lead to a compulsive concern that one might miss an opportunity for social interaction, a novel experience, a profitable investment, or other satisfying events. In other words, FOMO perpetuates the fear of having made the wrong decision on how to spend time since one "can imagine how things could be different".

These experiences that we don't want to miss on are oftentimes costly. That's how the fear gets to control your wallet and as a consequence your financial stability, all while it makes you feel miserable.

Pretty bad deal, wouldn't you say?

Having a budget means I have to say _no_ to many things. At any given time I have a handful of options and I choose what I want. I feel happy and satisfied and in control.

I felt that already before I was very little affected by the fear of missing out: I don't have Instagram and I block FB on my iPad. I've been meditating regularly for some 6–7 years and I came to have a great calm in my life.

But still, introducing a budget brought this calm to the next level, while it allows me to concentrate on what matters to me in my life. _I wish everyone to be able to feel this peace and satisfaction with what one has._
