# My cash-only envelope system

_For a long time I was very disorganized about my finances. I tried several apps and systems, but I wasn't able to stick to any of these, as I found all of them unnecessary complicated. So finally, I came up with my all system that's so easy even I am able to stick to it._

## Going cash-only

Never in my life I owned a credit card, believing it to be a horrible idea and a trap, despite being aware of its benefits. I of course own a debit card, but these days I use it only for online purchases (which I seldom do) and ... cash withdrawals.

I know the convenience of a debit card – or God forbid a credit card – you have all your money available (in case of a credit card, even money that's not even yours) at any moment, including when you're overwhelmed or your GF dumped you, which is a ~~great~~ terrible, terrible idea.

The point of having a budget is that you shouldn't be able to over to exceed it. If you can, then what's the point?

And here's my beef with debit cards: it's rather difficult to do that. Not without setting some automated transfer that'd send you only your weekly budget to your current balance, which I can't be bothered to do.

Therefore for my _regular expenses_, I decided to go cash-only.

## Regular expenses?

This is a crucial concept of this system: it's about usual day-to-day expenses: grocery shopping, mild luxuries (massage, therapy), anything that you do regularly enough and/or doesn't cost much.

I'm not suggesting you should use cash to buy a car for instance – I'm only talking about what I call regular expenses.

## Budgetting for week

Week is a perfect unit of time for keeping track of one's money.

Month is too long, so it's hard to know if you're spending too much or not and also have the annoying feature of having a different amount of days.

## The envelopes

### Dark blue envelope

Every Sunday evening I put my weekly budget in cash into the dark blue envelope. That's what I can afford to spend the coming week.

Apart from the cash I put inside an index card where I note how much I put in (the budget doesn't change from week to week, but just to be sure), how much money I take from the yellow envelope and on Sunday evening, I note how much has left.

### Yellow envelope

If there are still any money left on Sunday evening, I note how much it was on the index card and put them into the yellow envelope.

### Light blue envelope

Here I keep money for the coming weeks. I like to have have few weeks in advance, among other reasons, if I'd have issues with my card, I'd like to allow time to sort these out.
