# My cash-only envelope system

_Being reasonably organized is important, but the system is only useful if it's easy enough to use, to remember its rules and to analyze its outcomes. Here's how I manage my finance on week to week basis._

## Going cash-only

By using a debit card – or God forbid a credit card – is a convenient way to money you have, or even the money you don't even have.

Never in my life I owned a credit card, believing it to be a horrible idea, despite being aware of its benefits. I of course own a debit card, but these days I barely use it.

No solution to budgetting is more efficient than going cash only.

## Budgetting for week

Week is a perfect unit of time for keeping track of one's money.

Month is too long, so it's hard to know if you're on target or not and also have the annoying feature of having a different amount of days.

This is for REGULAR EXPENSES
