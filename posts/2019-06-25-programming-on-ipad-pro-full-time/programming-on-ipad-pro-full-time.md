# Programming on iPad Pro 12.9" full-time

_One year ago I went _

## How it all started

It was just before my holidays. I was in my room packing my hand luggage to go on vacations. Basic clothes, running shoes, toothbrush ... Suddenly my eyes landed on my old MacBook Air.

Considering how little work I had coming up, I really didn't feel like bringing it along.

Especially as the battery got rather weak. No wonder: I've been using it daily for nearly 5 years.

I decided I wouldn't take it. I went to the nearest Apple Store and bought an iPad Pro 10.5" with ApplePencil and SmartKeyboard.

Just to try it, I said. It was late June 2018.

## Fast-forward to now

It's going to be one year soon. Since then, I got rid off my old MacBook Air and I've been developing exclusively on iPad and I don't look back.

## Advantages

### LTE

### Screenshot annotation

### Battery life

### FaceID

### Flexibility

Rotating the screen, having it in the right position.
Home setup vs. work from a caf√© setup.

### Split-screen

I found the idea of overlapping windows bloated, annoying and unnecessary.

What iOS came up with is not exactly new: tile window managers on Linux have been doing it for a while. But it's an approach that works and makes sense.

## My Workflow

### Blink, Mosh, DigitalOcean & Docker-project-manager

Docker-project-manager

### Remotix, mouse, RDP & remote Windows in Azure

	"Hey man, the app is ready! It works great on mobile Safari on my iPad!"

It's crystal clear that as a professional web developer, I have to test on desktop browsers as well. Therefore, having access to a desktop OS is imperative.

And there's another thing: doing JS development without Chrome development tools is quite impossible.

Azure is the only service I pay for that I didn't pay for before. And it's costly: to have a decently fast Windows machine, I pay XXX monthly.

But ... I don't have to carry a notebook around. No one can steal it, and I will never need to buy a "new version": the cost of HW upgrades is not on me.

You might have noticed that the title talks about iPad Pro 12.9", while I said I bought iPad Pro 10.5".

As much as prefer the smaller one, testing a web app in such a small resolution simply is not an option. It's just too small. So I got the large iPad Pro and I use the small one as my personal device.
