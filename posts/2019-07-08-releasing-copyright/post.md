# Releasing copyright on everything on this blog

_I was never fond of copyrights, restrictive licenses and their enforcements such as DRM. 99% of my work is released on GitHub free for anyone to use. So it only makes sense that I'll do so with content of this blog._

First, let me give the credits Leo of zenhabits.net, who [released all his content free](https://zenhabits.net/uncopyright).

And since he did so, I'll just go right ahead and steal from the linked article. So here goes:

    This entire blog is uncopyrighted.

    That means I’ve put them in the public domain, and released my copyright on all these works.

    There is no need to email me for permission — use my content however you want! Email it, share it, reprint it with or without credit. Change it around, put in a bunch of swear words and attribute them to me. It’s OK.

    Attribution is appreciated but not required.

I found interesting what Leo says about his reasoning:

    I’m not a big fan of copyright laws, especially as they’re being applied by corporations, used to crack down on the little guys so they can continue their large profits.

     Copyrights are often said to protect the artist, but in most cases the artist gets very little while the corporations make most of the money. In the 4+ years I’ve done this experiment, releasing copyright has not hurt me, the creator of the content, a single bit.

     I think, in most cases, the protectionism that is touted by “anti-piracy” campaigns and lawsuits and lobbying actually hurts the artist. Limiting distribution to protect profits isn’t a good thing.

     The lack of copyright, and blatant copying by other artists and even businesses, never hurt Leonardo da Vinci when it comes to images such as the Mona Lisa, the Last Supper, or the Vitruvian Man. It’s never hurt Shakespeare. I doubt that it’s ever really hurt any artist (although I might just be ignorant here).

     And while I’m certainly not da Vinci or Shakespeare, copyright hasn’t helped me, and uncopyright hasn’t hurt me. If someone feels like sharing my content on their blog, or in any other form for that matter, that’s a good thing for me. If someone wanted to share my ebook with 100 friends, I don’t see how that hurts me. My work is being spread to many more people than I could do myself. That’s something to celebrate, as I see it.

     And if someone wants to take my work and improve upon it, as artists have been doing for centuries, I think that’s a wonderful thing. If they can take my favorite posts and make something funny or inspiring or thought-provoking or even sad … I say more power to them. The creative community only benefits from derivations and inspirations.

     This isn’t a new concept, of course, and I’m freely ripping ideas off here. Which is kinda the point.

I wholeheartedly agree and I'm joining the club. Thanks Leo for the inspiration!
