# March 2020 update

_Starting second career, helping out in my local community, quarantine in a tropic paradise ._

## Coronavirus

When the pandemic started to arrive to Mexico, I was just in Zipolite, Oaxaca. It's a small town with beautiful beaches, great food and very open-minded community of artisans and travellers.

I was due to return to Mexico City, but I decided that staying where I am is a safer option. I'm not so much afraid of the virus, but who knows what will happen in terms of food supplies, food prices and violence.

For me it's quite exiting not knowing what's going to happen. I don't care to know. I like the surprise.

The most interesting are the various attitudes of people. There are some that are constantly glued to the media, talking about the topic constantly and being stressed out.

Some others don't believe in the virus exists or that it's such a big deal, saying that it's lobby against China and I don't know what more.

Personally I believe that there's such virus and that it's a big mess, but that worrying won't help anyone. I'm happy, enjoying the beach, staying active, eating well and being fine with whatever's to come.
