# June 2019 update

_This month I'm working on my blog and publishing pipeline, looking for a contract work, trying to live healthier and experimenting with Oura ring to improve my sleep._

## This blog

I have a lot of work launching this blog. For that purpose I published:

- A [blog front-end engine][gh-blog-engine] in React.js.
- A [blog content compiler][gh-blog-generator] that allows me to write posts in markdown format and returns JSON files that the front-end engine consumes.
- Repository with [my blog posts][gh-data-blog] that includes both the markdown posts I've written and the generated JSON files. The JSON files get compiled on Travis CI.

_All these projects are available as open-source software, free for anyone to use. Visit the links the see the project pages on GitHub. Contributions welcomed._

## Looking for freelance work

I left TopTal after 5 years due to being grossly dissatisfied with the changes in there in the last 2 years.

Yes, automatisation, optimisation and outsourcing decreases the price, but if as a result of that your expert cannot get to his money for 3 weeks, and leaves as a result of that, was it really worth it?

So now I'm on a look out for freelance work. Anything in **Ruby**, **Ruby on Rails**, **JavaScript** and **React.js**.

My contact info is on the [about page](/about).

## Oura ring

As an ongoing effort to live healthier, I got the [Oura ring][oura-ring] tracker to track my sleep and activity.

It also tracks naps (automatically) and meditation.

Being a diehard minimalist, I was very hesitant to get anything I'd have to wear on my body, but my sleep wasn't great lately and a ring is something even I can accept.

The data seems to be useful, but I'm still in the testing phase, so the jury is still out.

## Health

- I **meditate** most of the days. I generally aim for 1 hour and I stick with it most of the time. I've been using the brilliant [LifeFlow brain synchronization][lifeflow] tracks for a good while now. I found them to have a noticeable effect on the quality of the meditation sessions.
- Oura ring has been nagging me to do more exercise, so I'm **jogging more frequently** now.
- After spending a month in Europe, where every meal comes with either potatoes or bread, I started to prepare **salad** for myself most of the days, out of pure desperation. Now, even when I'm back to Mexico, where the food is much more fresh and healthy, I still keep eating salad most of the days.

# Change of life values

I came to reevaluate my direction and values. During my 20s, I was always ready to party and my priorities were a lot about having fun, doing stupid things and traveling.

Many times it was great and many times it wasn't. It was necessary and I learnt a lot. Now passing to my 30s, I feel ready to turn the page and use my time more wisely.
