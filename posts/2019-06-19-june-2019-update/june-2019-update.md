# June 2019 update

_This month I'm working on my blog and publishing pipeline. I'm looking for contract programming work. I'm experimenting with Oura ring to improve my sleep and I'm trying to live healthier._

## This blog <i class="hashtag">IT</i>

I have a lot of work launching this blog. For that purpose I wrote:

- A [blog front-end engine][gh-blog-engine] in React.js.
- A [blog content compiler][gh-blog-generator] that allows me to write posts in markdown format and returns JSON files that then the front-end engine consumes.
- Repozitory with [my blog posts][gh-data-blog] that includes both the markdown posts I've written and the generated JSON files. The JSON files get compiled on Travis CI.
<!-- TODO: the runner to take it from Dropbox once I have a URL. -->

_All of these projects are available as open-source software, free for anyone to use. Visit the links the see the project pages on GitHub._

## Looking for freelance work *<span style="color: gray">#IT</span>*

I left TopTal after 5 years due to being disatisfied with the changes in there in the last 2 years.

Because of that, I'm on a look out for freelance work. Anything in **Ruby**, **Ruby on Rails**, **JavaScript** and **React.js**.

If you might be interested, please check my [about page](/about).

## Oura ring *<span style="color: gray">#health #tracking</span>*

As an ongoing effort to live healthier, I got the [Oura ring][oura-ring] tracker to track my sleep and activity.

It also tracks naps (automatically) and meditation.

Being a diehard minimalist, I was very hesitant to get anything I'd have to wear on my body, but ring is something even I can accept.

The data seems to be useful, but I'm still in the testing phase, so the judge is still out.

## Health

- I **meditate** most of the days. I generally aim for 1 hour and I stick with it most of the time. I've been using the brilliant [LifeFlow brain synchronization][lifeflow] tracks for a good while now. I found them to have a noticeable effect on the quality of the meditation sessions.
- Oura ring has been nagging me to do more exercise, so I'm **jogging more frequently** now.
- After spending a month in Europe, where every meal comes with either potatoes or bread, I started to prepare **salad** for me most of the days. Now, even when I'm back to Mexico, where the food is much more fresh and healthy, I still keep eating salad most of the days.

# Change of life values

After being enlightened by a divine influence, I came to reevaluate my direction and values. During my 20s, I was always ready to party and my priorities were a lot about having fun, doing stupid things and traveling.

Many times it was great and many times it wasn't. It was necessary and I learned a lot. Now passing to my 30s, I feel ready to turn the page and concentrate on more lasting things.
