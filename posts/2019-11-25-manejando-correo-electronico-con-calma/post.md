# Manejando correo electrónico con calma

_Email can be a giant pain in the arse. Some months ago I came up with a simple system for filtering email and it's been paying off._

First and foremost, it's important to filter personal email from mass email, such as notifications, newsletters and the like.

How? Gmail has this lovely feature that allows you to add `+anything` after your username and it will still get delivered to your inbox. And with Gmail filters, you can execute actions over matching emails, such as marking them as read and skipping the inbox.

_Wait, what?_

For instance if you're `joe@gmail.com`, you can also use `joe+newsletter@gmail.com`, `joe+notifications@gmail.com`, `joe+orders@gmail.com` and so on.

In my case, _I give my default email (one without `+whatever`) only to people, not to machines_.

So if I register for any app or online service, I'd always use `me+service@gmail.com` and then in [Gmail filters](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/filters) I'd use this:

Yeah, it's in Spanish ... it says skip the inbox, mark as read and apply the `service` label (so I can easily see all these service emails).

And that's it! All that makes it into my inbox is email I actually care about.
