# October 2019 update

_This past few months I had a lot of work, so I didn't manage to do much more than that. Finally now, in October, I made it to the mexican coast for some diving and spiritual reflection._

## Work

I work on a very interesting app. It's not launched yet, so I cannot talk about it, but once it launches, I'll be really curious to see if it picks up. It's a great idea and I enjoy working on it. Technically it's Ruby on Rails with React and CSS modules.

## Deepening of my spiritual understanding

After some 6 months of moreless regular meditation practice, a friend asked me to try Waking up app with him. Intuitively I feel something strange about Sam Harris, but the materials in the app are very enlightening and his guided meditation eventually made me break free from my ego and to "be the consciousness" or how to put it.

To me this was one of my most important spiritual breakthroughs of my life, it's very liberating and you start to see things with so much clarity, that was simply not possible before.

I also realized the difference between spiritual maturity and being able to "work energies". I thought these are the same, but lately I've seen first hand that there are people who can work energies in a very impressive manner, yet are spiritually immature and that combination is not good. It's like giving matches to kids.

So to anyone who's interested in spirituality and working energies, I'd recommend just to do meditation. Work day by day on being able to be more mindful. Work on you, without being obsessed with you. Step by step and then'll come the time when you might get interested knowing "who am I?" and after some reading and research, you'll hopefully find that ego is an illusion and that understanding will change your life.

At the same time if you want to work energies, there are certainly things you can do. Healing is a natural thing that's easy to start with. If you feel unsure about "just doing it", which is perfectly understandable, you can start with reiki. You don't need it, but it'll ease you into the realization that you also can do it.

Healing doesn't always work the way you expect it to, so it's worth researching it and then experimenting with it.

## Deep diving

After a few hectic months, I finally made it down to the coast of Mexico for some diving. I've done a deep diving course to understand more how I react in greater depths.

Overall, no big surprises. At about 40m I start to get nitrogen narcosis which I found to be really relaxing and enjoyable. It gradually gets stronger up to the 60m which is the maximum where we went, but I was still totally in control.

At 65m the oxygen toxicity gets real, so I see 60-62m as a hard limit for recreational diving.

We of coursed entered deco (some 12m of deco according to my dive computer) and we were happy that we have brought 2 spare air tanks (for 5 people).

My impression was that technically there is nothing difficult about diving at 60m. The big difference is that if you have an issue with equipment, from some 24m you make it to the surface no problem even would you run out of air.

From 60m, I doubt you would make it and if you would, it'd be straight to the decompression chamber if you'd be lucky.
