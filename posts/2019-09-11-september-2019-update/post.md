# September 2019 update

_I worked a lot for the past 2 months and I'm quite exhausted. I'm planning a retreat to relax and recover and to do some traveling._

## Work <i class="hashtag">IT</i>

I had plenty of work the past 2 months. It's a project in Ruby on Rails, React and Draft.js.

I'm the only developer on the project and it's fun, but equally it's exhausting.


## Partial migration from Things to Reminders <i class="hashtag">IT</i>

Things are the best GTD client out there for iOS, no comparison.

However they have 2 really big problems: the Shortcuts integration is limited and there is no collaboration.

To the first, for instance with Reminders it's possible to run a shortcut that displays a dialog with a selection from the tasks, I select which I'm working on and then it gets logged into a calendar for instance. Useful for Pomodoro. Things cannot do it.

Still, that's not the worst. Lack of collaboration is much worse.

I have 2 iPads: one that I use for work-related stuff. It's 12.9" and I don't carry it around. Then other one is the older 10.5" and I use it for my personal stuff. I do carry it around.

These iPads have a different purpose and in Things I have tasks that are specific to that purpose.

However there are projects that are relevant to me personally as well as to my work.

For instance working on OSS. I do it, because I enjoy it, but at the same time it gives me more credibility.

So I might work on it in different contexts from either of my iPads.

And since there's no sharing in Things, I migrated these tasks that are relevant to both contexts to Reminders and I share them across both machines.

I have to say Reminders are nowhere near where Things, nowhere near at all, but having all the relevant tasks at hand is more important than anything else.

## Planning to rest and travel  <i class="hashtag">health</i>

I've been in the city four months and I really need a break in a quiet environment.

I booked a flight to my secret destination in Caribbean and I'm going to spend at least 10 days there, just swimming, diving, eating octopus, meditating and writing.

Given that it's a village of 1000 people with only 1 bar that's usually empty, it's the only thing one can do there â€“ and thanks God for that.

After that, I'm going to go traveling. I haven't traveled this year and I think it's time. I don't know where I'll go yet, but it's going to be somewhere in Latin America.
