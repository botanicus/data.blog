# Meaning over goals

_It's this time of the year again, when people start their mental masturbation
with planning their new year's resolutions, only to break half of them with the hangover of the new year's celebrations._

If there's a deep-enough intrinsic meaning in a project I'm doing, there's no need for me to have goals. I don't say "my goal is to finish this project by XYZ:

Many times if you have to make it a goal, it's probably not worth doing. I'm not saying it's always the case

For instance let's say you have on your list "Learn French to conversation level by the ned of the year".

Why? If you have to remind you of that, it's not worth doing. If you need it, you'll learn it.

I lived in 5 countries and I learnt their languages out of necessity and in a reasonably short timeframe. I never made it a goal, it had intrinsic meaning to me.

I learnt programming when I was very in my teen years. I didn't need it, but I loved it. Again, no need for making it a goal: it was just fun.

## Mental masturbation

So why is it we are writing down all these things we want to do on a piece of paper?

So we don't forget them.

That's often because we have too many of them.

Whether that's the truth or not, one thing is certain: if you can forget it, it's not worth doing. (Unless you suffer from Alzheimer.)

## Clear your plate first

So I suggest you this: rather than tracking all the things that'd give you bragging rights in your social circle, just forget all about that and clear your plate first.

I strongly recommend you adhering to your own version of [digital minimalism](/posts/digital-minimalism), removing all the distractions, so you can concentrate on what matters.

Then find what really matters to you. (And here's a caveat: it's very easy to be tricked into believing something matters to you, if it sounds OK and you believe you can make good money of it. I've been there and it's natural. We all need to eat after all. Yet, I'd argue that it's not productive.)

## Processes

Since you removed all the distractions, now it shouldn't be so hard to implement the right processes, since you no longer have FB to waste your time on and million apps asking for your attention RIGHT NOW.

First and foremost, it's recommended to follow the advice of _putting your mask on first before helping others_. Being all stressed out will not help
