# Hello world!

_I decided to start blogging. Here is a brief overview of the topics I'm going to be writing about._

I always found writing deeply satisfying. My first job was technical writing and I went on doing so on and off throughout my carreer.

Still, ever since I switched to English as my main language, my writing never felt to me as refined as I would've hoped.

Then I added Spanish into the mix, which after I moved to Mexico came to be the language I speak most of the time and so my attention between languages has been diluted even further.

To complicate things further, I realized that speaking my mother tongue, Czech, actually doesn't come out as fluid and natural as it used to either.

So here I have it. Jack of all trades, master of none.

I hope to improve that by writing regularly.
