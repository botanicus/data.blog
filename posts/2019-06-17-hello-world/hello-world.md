# Hello world!

_The first blog post. Short one, more of a note on my relationship to writing._

I always found writing deeply satisfying. My first job was technical writing and I went on doing so on and off throughout my career.

Still, ever since I switched to English as my main language, my writing never felt to me as refined as I would've hoped.

Then I added Spanish into the mix, which after I moved to Mexico ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ came to be the language I speak the most and so my attention between languages has been diluted even further.

And to complicate things further, I realized that speaking my very own mother tongue, Czech ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿, actually doesn't come out as fluid and natural as it used to either.

So here I have it. Jack of all trades, master of none.

I hope to improve that by writing regularly.
