# Hello world!

_So it happened to me as well: I decided to start blogging. I always enjoyed writing. As I haven't found a platform I'd like, I wrote my own blog engine (no ads, hurray!), blog content compiler. So what is it I'm going to be writing about?_

Eventually I decided to write my own [blog engine][gh-blog-engine] and [blog content compiler][gh-blog-generator], I got the incredibly useful Editorial app for iOS and I'm good to go!

## What am I going to be writing about?

### Working on an iPad Pro
In June 2018 I bought iPad Pro 10.5" with SmartKeyboard as an experiment to see whether I can manage to code on it for 2 months when I was traveling. It turns out that not only it's possible, indeed I found it so much better, that I switch to **coding on iPad full-time** and currently I don't even own a MacBook or any other computer.

To me this is a fascinating new world and I really enjoy fiddling with the possibilities of iOS and the cloud and since none of my friends cares, well, I got a blog ...

### Ruby/JS development
Being a Ruby/JS developer, you can certainly expect some of that as well.

### Minimalistic lifestyle
Even though I already sold my camper in which I lived for 3 years, I haven't sold minimalistic principles. After all, this is why I got into working full-time on iPad in the first place.

### My hobbies
And last, but not least, I might write some posts about other topics I enjoy: especially learning languages and diving.

## Blog engine as a playground
Even though I do Ruby and React.js at work, I still enjoy working with it in my spare time.

React.js and the whole web landscape has been developing rapidly and I need an app where I can play around with the new stuff, before I can dare to propose to my clients we should "just adopt it". Something small, so it doesn't require too much time, but not too small, so I can get a reasonable insight into each new feature before adopting it in more important projects.

## Writing habit
Another motivation is that I'd like to get better at writing. I used to be fairly good with words, in my view. After all, technical writing was my first job.
English, now not even speaking EN ...
