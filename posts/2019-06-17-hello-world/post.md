# Hello world!

_The first blog post. Short one, more of a note about what the blog is going to be about._

I always found writing deeply satisfying. My first job was technical writing and I went on doing so on and off throughout my career.

Still, ever since I switched to English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ as my main language, my writing never felt as refined as I was used to.

Then I added Spanish into the mix, which after I moved to Mexico ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ came to be the language I speak the most and so my attention has been diluted even further.

And to complicate things more, I realized that speaking my very own mother tongue, Czech ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿, actually doesn't come out as fluid and natural as it used to either.

So here I have it. Jack of all trades, master of none.

I hope to improve that by writing regularly.

And what I'm going to write about? Anything from my life. I'm interested in spirituality and minimalism a lot
