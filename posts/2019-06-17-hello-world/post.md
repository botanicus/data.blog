# Hello world!

_The first blog post. Short one, more of a note about what the blog is going to be about._

I always found writing deeply satisfying. My first job was technical writing and I went on doing so on and off throughout my career.

Ever since I was a child _I had very different opinions_ about the world and our role in it. In school I wasn't very popular with the teachers, because I dared to think for myself and refused to go with _"this is how things are done around here"_.

As years went by I got more and more confidence about my ideas. _I saw that they work._ I was able to start a successful career in IT in under a year and earn enough to travel the world, learn and enjoy.

Eventually as I got more mature, travelling and enjoying decreased in importance for me and I started to feel _desire to use my experience for the benefit of others_.

And this is why I'm starting this blog. I'm not a know-it-all. I don't have all the recipes, no one does. But having lived a very varied life, I can relate to many people.

And it's not just that I traveled the world and lived with various cultures ever since I was 19. No. This of course is something that formed me a lot, but what formed me even more were the not so glamorous parts of life: _needing alcohol in order to get by, taking drugs, feeling crushing loneliness, not talking to my dad for 10 years, lack of sense in life, not having money even to buy food with and so on_.

Eventually with the help of my therapist and spiritual guide, Maricela, I was able to overcome these.

By getting to know the ups and downs of life, I learnt to appreciate and enjoy the human condition, as difficult and crushingly heavy it can be at times. I learnt _not to judge_ and _not to assume_.

I learnt that my place is to be helping people, putting my life experience into a good use by _listening_, _being present_ and _sharing_.

This blog is a small part of the puzzle in my efforts to do just that.

I'm going to write about anything from life, but I have my favourite topics:

- **Minimalism**, living a **low-tech lifestyle**, prioritising **time over money** and **being present**. If you ask me, these are the keys to living a satisfied, honest life.
- **Spirituality**. Like it or not, there's much more to our existence than our monkey bodies and minds. For me personally, spirituality is a huge part of what gives my life a meaning. I have certain spiritual gifts that allow me to help myself and others and I deeply enjoy doing so.

Welcome!
