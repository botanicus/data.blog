# Hello world!

_The first blog post. Short one, more of a note about what the blog is going to be about._

I always found writing deeply satisfying. My first job was technical writing and I went on doing so on and off throughout my career.

Ever since I was a child _I had very different opinions_ about the world and our role in it. In school I wasn't very popular with the teachers, because I dared to think for myself and refused to go with _"this is how things are done around here"_.

As years went by I got more and more confidence about my ideas. _I saw that they work._ I was able to start a successful career in IT in under a year and earn enough to travel the world, learn and enjoy.

Eventually as I got more mature, travelling and enjoying decreased in importance for me and I started to feel _desire to use my experience for the benefit of others_.

And this is why I'm starting this blog. I'm not a know-it-all. I don't have all the recipes, no one does. But having lived a very varied life, I can relate to many people.



At times I had no money, so I can relate to the poor. Other times I had a lot of money, so I can relate to the rich too. I got to know people from many different cultures and I learnt to appreciate them.

By getting to know the ups and downs of life, I learnt to appreciate and enjoy the human condition, as difficult and harsh it can be at times.

For a long time I wasn't satisfied with my career in IT. Sure, it gave me a great lifestyle: I didn't have to go to any office, I worked remotely, and it always paid really well. But I felt void in me, I wasn't doing something that'd be personally meaningful to me.

Then I learnt that my place is to be helping people, putting my life experience into a good use by listening, being present and sharing.

I'm going to write about anything from life, but I have my favourite topics:

- **Minimalism**, living a **low-tech lifestyle**, prioritising **time over money** and **being present**. If you ask me, these are the keys to living a satisfied, honest life.
- **Spirituality**. Like it or not, there's much more to our existence than our monkey bodies and minds. For me personally, spirituality is a huge part of what gives my life a meaning. I have certain spiritual gifts that allow me to help myself and others and I deeply enjoy doing so.

This blog is a small part of the puzzle in my efforts to do just that.

Welcome!
