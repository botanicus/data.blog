# Hello world!

_The first blog post. Short one, more of a note about what the blog is going to be about._

I always found writing deeply satisfying. My first job was technical writing and I went on doing so on and off throughout my career.

Ever since I was a child I had very different opinions about the world and our role in it. In school I wasn't very popular with the teachers, because I dared to think for myself and refused to go with "this is how things are done around here".

As years went by I got more and more confidence about my ideas. I saw that they work. I was able to start a successful career in IT in under a year and earn enough to travel the world, learn and enjoy.

Eventually as I got more mature, travelling and enjoying decreased in importance for me and I started to desire to use my experience



Still, ever since I switched to English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ as my main language, my writing never felt as refined as I was used to.

Then I added Spanish into the mix, which after I moved to Mexico ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ came to be the language I speak the most and so my attention has been diluted even further.

And to complicate things more, I realized that speaking my very own mother tongue, Czech ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿, actually doesn't come out as fluid and natural as it used to either.

So here I have it. Jack of all trades, master of none.

I hope to improve that by writing regularly.

And what I'm going to write about? Anything from my life. I'm interested minimalism and spirituality a lot, living low-tech lifestyle and being happy in the craziness of modern world.
