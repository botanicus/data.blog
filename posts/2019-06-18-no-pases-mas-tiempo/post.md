# Porque no quiero que pases más tiempo en mi blog

_Mi amigo dice que el tráfico es el nuevo petróleo. Estos días todo se trata de involucramiento, los <abbr title="Key performance indicator, indicador clave de rendimiento"> KPIs</abbr>, enlaces visitados de anuncios etcétera. Esto se usa para objetivos tan nobles como convencer a la gente que vote para Brexit o beba más alcohol. Y si por nada de estos, por lo menos para subir el consumismo. No me parece bien._

Recuerdo los primeros días del web. El sonido ridículo del módem que podría despertar toda la cuadra; velocidades tan bajas que tomó unos buenos 5 minutos para descargar una imagen de chica desnuda en baja resolución y también, el comienzo de los blogs.

En estos días escribir un blog no era una profesión. No se hacía para ganar dinero. _Lo hacía gente que era emocionada para tener su voz en el mundo._

_Ejecutando el derecho de la libertad de expresión_ en una escala tan grande, que para una persona corriente era impensable antes.

El web tenía su personalidad. Todos los escritores eran diferentes y hablaban libremente de lo que se les pegaba la gana. Era un arte

The web had its personality. Every writer was different and was talking freely about whatever he wanted. It was art of itself and as much as many bloggers were addicted to following their Google Analytics dashboard, the answer to what to do to have more readers was simple: _keep writing, improve your writing style and refine your message._

There were very few articles like _"6 reasons to be addicted to blog title generator"_, _"I migrated my blog away from Medium. Find out why."_ and so on.

Fast-forward 20 years and the picture is quite different. _Searching through Google is like digging through a rubbish bin._ Some things might look somewhat edible, but ultimately most of it is just rotten.

I'm not saying no one is blogging _primarily_ for personal expression, but I'm saying that these people get much less visibility these days, since these people generally care (and know) very little about <abbr title="Search engine optimization">SEO</abbr> and they simply cannot compete with professional blogs that are backed by a whole team of people.

And I generally think amateur blogging without _dominating_ business agenda became much less of a thing that it used to be.

The other thing is the **extent of self-censorship** people employ these days. When blogs just emerged, barely anyone was thinking about the posibility that saying something silly online could ruin one's career.

This is no longer the case and many people are really cautious discussing their opinions online.

And OK, I get it. These things are real, there is no doubt about it. But _living life based in fears is dumb and boring way to live_, fullstop.

Web sold out its soul and got handsomely paid.

But I'm not doing it. There are not going to be ads or posts that "you might also enjoy" full of rubbish.

In the <abbr title="Open-source software">OSS</abbr> community, we learned that openness does pay off. Many tools are open and free to use and everyone benefits.

So in times when shady social networks are routinely used to [spreading dangerous propaganda][ted-on-brexit] with the most serious consequences, we need more people that brings their hearts and souls into writing.

People who won't write in favor of the highest bidder, but will speak their truth rather than what's expected and politically correct.

The best things in life are free.
