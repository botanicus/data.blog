  I'm just finishing The science of well-being course on Coursera by Yale professor Laurie Santos.
  As I was getting through the episodes, I couldn't help to notice that I've already implemented most
  of these strategies myself.
</p>

<p>
  And as much as Laurie's course is good and insightful, there's one fundamental thing I just cannot agree with:
  it just feels all a bit too effortful (a word Laurie itself used in the video).
  She also said that she's been struggling with happiness herself.
</p>

<p>
  No wonder.
</p>

<p>
  Things that work only when you're doing well are very dangerous.
  You're doing fine, all is good, you're sticking to all your habits.
  Then something happens. Say you loose a job and you're stressed about
  not having money if you don't find anything new soon.
  That throws you out of your routines.
  We don't need prof. Maslow to remind us that if we're facing potential hunger, anything else is irrelevant.

  So you stop your routines.
  That will weakens you even more compared to when you were doing well.
</p>

<p>
  And if you happen to have unhealthy coping mechanism for stress, shopping, alcohol, smoking or whatnot:
  bingo! Perfect recipe for a real disaster.
</p>

<p>
  So no, if our well-being is to be stable, one that makes us stronger always and don't hurt us when we're feeling down,
  It's got to be effortless.
