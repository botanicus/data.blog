My first job was technical writing, which I did on and off throughout my carreer.\n\nQuite frankly I feel my\n:czech_republic:\n:+1:\n\nI always enjoyed writing. As I haven't found a platform I'd like, I wrote my own blog engine (no ads, hurray!), blog content compiler. So what is it I'm going to be writing about?_\n\nEventually I decided to write my own [blog engine][gh-blog-engine] and [blog content compiler][gh-blog-generator], I got the incredibly useful Editorial app for iOS and I'm good to go!\n\n## What am I going to be writing about?\n\n### Working on an iPad Pro\nIn June 2018 I bought iPad Pro 10.5\" with SmartKeyboard as an experiment to see whether I can manage to code on it for 2 months when I was traveling.

Something small, so it doesn't require too much time, but not too small, so I can get a reasonable insight into each new feature before adopting it in more important projects.\n\n## Writing habit\nAnother motivation is that I'd like to get better at writing.
