I don't say _\"my goal is to finish this project by XYZ\"_.\n\nMany times if you have to make it a goal, it's probably not worth doing. I'm not saying it's always the case\n\nFor instance let's say you have on your list \"Learn French to conversation level by the ned of the year\".\n\nWhy? If you have to remind you of that, it's not worth doing. If you need it, you'll learn it.\n\nI lived in 5 countries and I learnt their languages out of necessity and in a reasonably short timeframe. I never made it a goal, it had intrinsic meaning to me.\n\nI learnt programming when I was very in my teen years. I didn't need it, but I loved it. Again, no need for making it a goal: it was just fun.\n\n## Mental masturbation\n\nSo why is it we are writing down all these things we want to do on a piece of paper?\n\nSo we don't forget them.\n\nThat's often because we have too many of them.\n\nWhether that's the truth or not, one thing is certain: if you can forget it, it's not worth doing. (Unless you suffer from Alzheimer.)\n\n## Clear your plate first\n\nSo I suggest you this: rather than tracking all the things that'd give you bragging rights in your social circle, just forget all about that and clear your plate first.\n\nI strongly recommend you adhering to your own version of [digital minimalism](/posts/digital-minimalism), removing all the distractions, so you can concentrate on what matters.\n\nThen find what really matters to you. (And here's a caveat: it's very easy to be tricked into believing something matters to you, if it sounds OK and you believe you can make good money of it. I've been there and it's natural. We all need to eat after all. Yet, I'd argue that it's not productive.)\n\n## Processes\n\nSince you removed all the distractions, now it shouldn't be so hard to implement the right processes, since you no longer have FB to waste your time on and million apps asking for your attention RIGHT NOW.\n\nFirst and foremost, it's recommended to follow the advice of _putting your mask on first before helping others_. Being all stressed out will not help\n\nMeditation","tags":[{"name":"meaning","slug":"meaning","path":"/tags/meaning.json"},{"name":"goals","slug":"goals","path":"/tags/goals.json"},{"name":"new year's resolutions","slug":"new-year's-resolutions","path":"/tags/new-year's-resolutions.json"}]}
