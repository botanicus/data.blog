Some months ago I came up with a simple system for filtering email and it's been paying off.","body":"First and foremost, it's important to filter personal email from mass email, such as notifications, newsletters and the like.\n\nHow? Gmail has this lovely feature that allows you to add `+anything` after your username and it will still get delivered to your inbox.\n\nFor instance if you're `joe@gmail.com`, you can also use `joe+newsletter@gmail.com`, `joe+notifications@gmail.com`, `joe+orders@gmail.com` and so on.\n\nIn my case, I give my default email (one without `+whatever`) only to people, not to machines.\n\nSo if I register for any app or online service, I'd always use `me+service@gmail.com`.\n\nThat means that all the notification emails will get delivered to `me+service@gmail.com` and ... I filter them.\n\n\n[Gmail filters](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/filters)\n\n![gmail-filter-service.jpg](managing-email-with-ease/gmail-filter-service.jpg)","tags":[{"name":"Gmail","slug":"gmail","path":"/tags/gmail.json"},{"name":"email","slug":"email","path":"/tags/email.json"}]}
