These days everything is about engagement, KPIs, ad links clicked, and so on. This is then used for such a noble purposes as persuading people to vote for Brexit or consume more alcohol. And if neither of these, then at least to increase consumerism. I don't think it's right.","body":"I remember the beginnings of the web. The ridiculous noise of model dialing that woke up the whole block; speeds so low, that it took good 5 minutes to download a low resolution picture of a naked girl and also the beginnings of blogs.\n\nBack then blogging wasn't done as a profession. It wasn't done for profit. _It was done by people who were excited that they got their voice in the world._\n\nExecuting the right of free speech on a scale that was unthinkable for a normal person of standard means before.\n\nThe web had its personality. Every writer was different and was talking freely about whatever he wanted. It was art of itself and as much as many bloggers were addicted to following their Google Analytics dashboard, the answer to what to do to have more readers was simple: _keep writing, improve your writing style and refine your message._\n\nThere were very few articles like _\"6 reasons to be addicted to blog title generator\"_, _\"I migrated my blog away from Medium. Find out why.\"_ and so on.\n\n---\n\nFast-forward 20 years and the picture is quite different. _Searching through Google is like digging through a rubbish bin._ Some things might look somewhat edible, but ultimately most of it is just rotten.\n\nI'm not saying no one is blogging purely for personal expression, but I'm saying that these people get much less visibility these days, since these people generally care (and know) very little about <abbr title=\"Search engine optimization\">SEO</abbr> and they simply cannot compete with professional blogs that are backed by a whole team of people.\n\nWeb sold out it's soul and got handsomely paid.\n\nBut I'm not doing it. There are not going to be ads or posts that \"you might also enjoy\".\n\nIn the <abbr title=\"Open-source software\">OSS</abbr> community, we learned that openness does pay off. Many tools are open and free to use and everyone benefits.\n\nIf you have an idea for say an app, you can build a basic proof of concept in a week thanks to all these open tools available.\n\nThere are many jobs improving OSS projects. Years ago, I was hired to work on the AMQP Ruby gem. It's open and free, but I got paid to do the work.\n\n---\n\nSo in times when shady social networks are routinely used to [spreading propaganda][ted-on-brexit] with the most serious consequences, we need more people that brings their hearts and souls into writing.\n\nPeople who won't write in favour of the highest bidder, but will speak their truth.\n\nThe best things in life are free.\n\n\n[ted-on-brexit]: https://www.ted.com/talks/carole_cadwalladr_facebook_s_role_in_brexit_and_the_threat_to_democracy","tags":[{"name":"social critique","slug":"social-critique","path":"/tags/social-critique.json"},{"name":"capitalism","slug":"capitalism","path":"/tags/capitalism.json"},{"name":"consumerism","slug":"consumerism","path":"/tags/consumerism.json"},{"name":"advertising","slug":"advertising","path":"/tags/advertising.json"}]}
