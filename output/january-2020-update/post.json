Besides, this is much more about wisdom and insight, which is something one cannot learn at school.\n\nI want my service to be available to everyone rather than optimising for my economic situation. This will certainly impact my economic situation, so I'm already learning to live more on budget.\n\n## Going to therapy\n\n.....\n\n## Fighting phlegm\n\nFor the past 2 years my digestion system was regularly upset, until finally I learnt a bit about <abbr title=\"Traditional Chinese medicine\">TCM</abbr>, adjusted my diet, and this problem stopped.\n\nIt ain't finished still, and I've been having issues with too much phlegm. Currently, touch wood, this doesn't cause any more issues, but it's a sign of misbalance, and I'm trying to eliminate it.\n\nSince I have _yang deficiency_, I bought small thermos that I always have on me and I try to drink hot ginger tea as much as I can. (Hot drinks are more yang and ginger as well.) I'm trying to eat yang foods in general and avoid yin foods as much as reasonably possible.\n\nI found TCM fascinating, it's a very accessible knowledge, anyone can manage to learn the basics and benefit.\n\n## Tuning into the \"God's embrace\"\n\nEvery time I do anything spiritual, I tune into a special space, where I'm very quiet. Just like in meditation, but the difference is that in meditation, at least the way I practice it, there's emptiness. In this state, there is _Light_ and _Love_.\n\nMy spiritual guide calls it being embraced by God.\n\nSince I know how it's supposed to feel, I decided to recreate this state in meditation, to change my meditation practice, as I found this still working as a meditation, as in noticing thoughts and all that, but at same time being ultimately more beautiful and enjoyable.\n\nSince doing healing is what tunes me into this space, I often start meditation with some self-healing to help me with that.\n\n## Improving the blog\n\nI know no one really reads the blog, but I really don't care. I write it for me and I really enjoy it, I always loved writing.\n\nI'm making many improvements to make the app more usable, simpler and more performant.","tags":[{"name":"now","slug":"now","path":"/tags/now.json"},{"name":"TCM","slug":"tcm","path":"/tags/tcm.json"}]}
