So after an incident involving sea water, which rendered my phone unusable, I decided I wouldn't bother buying a new phone. One month in an I don't miss the bloody thing.","body":"# Without a phone ... again\n\n\nI like to swim in the sea. Turns out that my phone doesn't. I had it in a case that was waterproof – or so I thought. It was a very cheap Huawei, so whatever.\n\nBeing under the impression that I \"need\" a phone, I started to investigate what are my options. I always buy cheap phones, but given my taste for Apple products, I decided I'd take a peak.\n\nI wen to an Apple Store, and quite frankly, I was not impressed by what I saw even the slightest bit. So let me get it out of the way:\n\n_Dear Apple, if you think I lost my mind to pay money that would buy me a new notebook for a thing that serves to send texts (which I never do), make calls (which I never do), read maps and be available on WhatsApp and Messenger, then I assure you I have not._\n\n_Great that it's got 50 cameras and it can send messages to Mars, and one can use it to splash his toilet if he's so lazy to reach for the [thing], I just don't care._\n\nAnd since I'm well going with my rant, what's the deal with these big phones? Steve Jobs used to laugh at the idea and I was always of the same belief.\n\n_I don't want a bloody brick in my pocket._\n\n---\n\nWell, never mind then.

This would\n\n## Issues: using it on the street\n\nI admit that an iPad is not the most convenient device to read a map. Does it matter? I still use it like that. And my navigation sense improved a lot, because in effect, I'm more mindful of the route, because it's a hassle trying to navigate with an iPad.\n\nSeriously, we don't even realize how much we are outsourcing our brain activity to a phone. My friend ... navigation ... I knew casi always WTF.\n\n## Issues: am I supposed to take it to a bar, just so I can order Uber?\n\nAlcohol & expensive device.\nDon't got to bars.","tags":[{"name":"minimalism","slug":"minimalism","path":"/tags/minimalism.json"},{"name":"low-tech lifestyle","slug":"low-tech-lifestyle","path":"/tags/low-tech-lifestyle.json"}]}
