I wanted to see whether I can manage to survive holidays with occasional coding with only an iPad Pro and SmartKeyboard. The experiment turned into a huge success. I ended up selling my MacBook and never looking back.","body":"## How it all started\n\nIt was just before my holidays. I was in my room packing my hand luggage to go on vacations. Basic clothes, running shoes, toothbrush ... Suddenly my eyes landed on my old MacBook Air.\n\nSomehow I didn't feel like bringing it along. I didn't have much work coming up and the battery of this computer grandfather got really weak. No wonder: I've been using it daily for nearly 5 years.\n\nSo I decided I wouldn't take it. I went to the nearest Apple Store and bought an <i class=\"hashtag\">iPad Pro 10.5\"</i> with <i class=\"hashtag\">Apple Pencil</i> and <i class=\"hashtag\">SmartKeyboard</i>.\n\nJust to try it, I said. It was late June 2018.\n\n## Fast-forward to now\n\nIt's going to be one year soon. Since then, I got rid off my old MacBook Air and I've been developing exclusively on an iPad Pro and I don't look back.\n\nI upgraded since then to <i class=\"hashtag\">iPad Pro 12.9\"</i>, since it turned out testing web apps on 10.5\" screen is simply not viable, but I'm still on an iPad Pro.\n\n## Advantages\n\n### LTE\n\nAt times I go and work from the park. I watch the squirrels when I'm tired, walk a bit and the go on working.\n\nI sometimes take the iPad out and work in places where I otherwise wouldn't bother.\n\nI don't need to wait for a lazy waitress to bring me a note with barely readable 32 character long weird WiFi password.\n\nAnd finally ... if the WiFi sucks, as it often does, LTE saves the day.\n\n### Screenshot annotation\n\nBeing a web developer, vast majority of bugs manifests itself in a visible form.\n\nThere's nothing easier than taking a screenshot and annotating it with the Apple Pencil and then just uploading it into client's bug tracking system.\n\n![](screenshot-annotation.jpg)\n\n### Battery life\n\n### FaceID\n\n### Flexibility\n\nRotating the screen, having it in the right position.\nHome setup vs. work from a caf√© setup.\n\n### Split-screen\n\nI found the idea of overlapping windows bloated, annoying and unnecessary.\n\nWhat iOS came up with is not exactly new: tile window managers on Linux have been doing it for a while. But it's an approach that works and makes sense.\n\n## My Workflow\n\n### Blink, Mosh, DigitalOcean & Docker-project-manager\n\nDocker-project-manager\n\n### Remotix, mouse, RDP & remote Windows in Azure\n\n\t\"Hey man, the app is ready! It works great on mobile Safari on my iPad!\"\n\nIt's crystal clear that as a professional web developer, I have to test on desktop browsers as well. Therefore, having access to a desktop OS is imperative.\n\nAnd there's another thing: doing JS development without Chrome development tools is quite impossible.\n\nAzure is the only service I pay for that I didn't pay for before. And it's costly: to have a decently fast Windows machine, I pay XXX monthly.\n\nBut ... I don't have to carry a notebook around. No one can steal it, and I will never need to buy a \"new version\": the cost of HW upgrades is not on me.\n\nYou might have noticed that the title talks about iPad Pro 12.9\", while I said I bought iPad Pro 10.5\".\n\nAs much as prefer the smaller one, testing a web app in such a small resolution simply is not an option. It's just too small. So I got the large iPad Pro and I use the small one as my personal device.","tags":[{"name":"iPad Pro","slug":"ipad-pro","path":"/tags/ipad-pro.json"}]}
