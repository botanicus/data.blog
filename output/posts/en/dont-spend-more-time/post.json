These days everything is about engagement, KPIs, ad links clicked, and so on. This is then used for such a noble purposes as persuading people to vote for Brexit or consume more alcohol. And if neither of these, then at least to increase consumerism. I don't think it's right.","body":"I remember the beginnings of the web. The ridiculous noise of model dialing that woke up the whole block; speeds so low, that it took good 5 minutes to download a low resolution picture of a naked girl and also the beginnings of blogs.\n\nBack then blogging wasn't done as a profession. It wasn't done for profit. _It was done by people who were excited that they got their voice in the world._\n\n_Executing the right of free speech_ on a scale that was unthinkable for a normal person of standard means before.\n\nThe web had its personality. Every writer was different and was talking freely about whatever he wanted. It was art of itself and as much as many bloggers were addicted to following their Google Analytics dashboard, the answer to what to do to have more readers was simple: _keep writing, improve your writing style and refine your message._\n\nThere were very few articles like _\"6 reasons to be addicted to blog title generator\"_, _\"I migrated my blog away from Medium. Find out why.\"_ and so on.\n\n---\n\nFast-forward 20 years and the picture is quite different. _Searching through Google is like digging through a rubbish bin._ Some things might look somewhat edible, but ultimately most of it is just rotten.\n\nI'm not saying no one is blogging _primarily_ for personal expression, but I'm saying that these people get much less visibility these days, since these people generally care (and know) very little about <abbr title=\"Search engine optimization\">SEO</abbr> and they simply cannot compete with professional blogs that are backed by a whole team of people.\n\nAnd I generally think amateur blogging without _dominating_ business agenda became much less of a thing that it used to be.\n\nThe other thing is the **extent of self-censorship** people employ these days. When blogs just emerged, barely anyone was thinking about the posibility that saying something silly online could ruin one's career.\n\nThis is no longer the case and many people are really cautious discussing their opinions online.\n\nAnd OK, I get it. These things are real, there is no doubt about it. But _living life based in fears is dumb and boring way to live_, fullstop.\n\nWeb sold out its soul and got handsomely paid.\n\nBut I'm not doing it. There are not going to be ads or posts that \"you might also enjoy\" full of rubbish.\n\nIn the <abbr title=\"Open-source software\">OSS</abbr> community, we learned that openness does pay off. Many tools are open and free to use and everyone benefits.\n\n---\n\nSo in times when shady social networks are routinely used to [spreading dangerous propaganda][ted-on-brexit] with the most serious consequences, we need more people that brings their hearts and souls into writing.\n\nPeople who won't write in favor of the highest bidder, but will speak their truth rather than what's expected and politically correct.\n\nThe best things in life are free.\n\n\n[ted-on-brexit]: https://www.ted.com/talks/carole_cadwalladr_facebook_s_role_in_brexit_and_the_threat_to_democracy","lang":"en","translations":{"es":"no-pases-mas-tiempo"},"tags":[{"name":"social critique","slug":"social-critique","path":"/tags/social-critique.json"},{"name":"capitalism","slug":"capitalism","path":"/tags/capitalism.json"},{"name":"consumerism","slug":"consumerism","path":"/tags/consumerism.json"},{"name":"advertising","slug":"advertising","path":"/tags/advertising.json"}]}
