Short one, more of a note about what the blog is going to be about.","body":"I always found writing deeply satisfying. My first job was technical writing and I went on doing so on and off throughout my career.\n\nStill, ever since I switched to English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ as my main language, my writing never felt as refined as I was used to.\n\nThen I added Spanish into the mix, which after I moved to Mexico ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ came to be the language I speak the most and so my attention has been diluted even further.\n\nAnd to complicate things more, I realized that speaking my very own mother tongue, Czech ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿, actually doesn't come out as fluid and natural as it used to either.\n\nSo here I have it. Jack of all trades, master of none.\n\nI hope to improve that by writing regularly.","lang":"en","translations":{"es":"hola-a-todos"},"tags":[]}
