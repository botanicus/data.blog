Short one, more of a note about what the blog is going to be about.","body":"I always found writing deeply satisfying. My first job was technical writing and I went on doing so on and off throughout my career.\n\nEver since I was a child I had very different opinions about the world and our role in it. In school I wasn't very popular with the teachers, because I dared to think for myself and refused to go with \"this is how things are done around here\".\n\nAs years went by I got more and more confidence about my ideas. I saw that they work. I was able to start a successful career in IT in under a year and earn enough to travel the world, learn and enjoy.\n\nEventually as I got more mature, travelling and enjoying decreased in importance for me and I started to desire to use my experience to help others.\n\nAnd this is why I'm starting this blog. I'm not a know it all. I don't have all the recipes, no one does. But having lived a very varied life, I can relate to many people.\n\nAt times I had no money, so I can relate to the poor. Other times I had a lot of money, so I can relate to the rich too. I got to know people from many different cultures and I learnt to appreciate them.\n\nBy getting to know the ups and downs of life, I learnt to appreciate and enjoy the human condition, as difficult and harsh it can be at times.\n\nFor a long time I wasn't satisfied with my career in IT. Sure, it gave me a great lifestyle: I didn't have to go to any office, I worked remotely, and it always paid really well. But I felt void in me, I wasn't doing something that'd be personally meaningful to me.\n\nThen I learnt that my place is to be helping people, putting my life experience into a good use by listening, being present and sharing.\n\nThis blog is a small part of the puzzle in my efforts to do just that.\n\nWelcome!","lang":"en","translations":{"es":"hola-a-todos"},"tags":[]}
