{"title":"Hello world!","slug":"hello-world","path":"/posts/hello-world/post.json","date":"2019-06-17T22:21:00Z","excerpt":"The first blog post about who I am and what the blog is going to be about and why it matters to me personally.","body":"I always found writing deeply satisfying. My first job was technical writing and I went on doing so on and off throughout my career.\n\nEver since I was a child _I had very different opinions_ about the world and our role in it. In school I wasn't very popular with the teachers, because I dared to think for myself and refused to go with _\"this is how things are done around here\"_.\n\nAs years went by, I got more and more confidence about my ideas. _I saw that they work._ I was able to start a successful career in IT in under a year and earn enough to travel the world, learn and enjoy.\n\nEventually as I got more mature, travelling and hedonism decreased in importance for me and I started to feel _desire to use my experience for the benefit of others_.\n\nThis is why I'm starting this blog. I'm not a know-it-all. I don't have all the recipes, no one does. But having lived a very diverse life, I can relate to many people.\n\nAnd it's not just that I traveled the world and lived with various cultures ever since I was 19. No. This of course is something that formed me a lot, but what formed me even more were the not so glamorous parts of life: _needing alcohol in order to get by, taking drugs, feeling the crushing weight loneliness, not talking to my father for 10 years, missing the lack of sense in life, not having money even to buy food with and so on_.\n\nEventually with the help of my therapist and spiritual guide, Maricela, I was able to overcome these issues and many more.\n\nBy getting to know the ups and downs of life, I learnt to appreciate and enjoy the human condition, as difficult and heavy it can be at times. I learnt _not to judge_ and _not to assume_.\n\nI learnt that my place is to be helping people, putting my life experience into a good use by _listening_, _being present_ and _sharing_.\n\nThis blog is a small part of the puzzle in my efforts to do just that.\n\nI'm going to write about anything from life, but I have my favourite topics:\n\n- **Minimalism**, living a **low-tech lifestyle**, prioritising **time over money** and **being present**. If you ask me, these are the keys to living a satisfied, honest life.\n- **Spirituality**. Like it or not, there's much more to our existence than our monkey bodies and minds. For me personally, spirituality is a huge part of what gives my life a meaning. I have certain spiritual gifts that allow me to help myself and others and I deeply enjoy doing so.","lang":"en","translations":{"es":"hola-a-todos"},"tags":[]}
