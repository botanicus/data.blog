Short one, more of a note about what the blog is going to be about.","body":"I always found writing deeply satisfying. My first job was technical writing and I went on doing so on and off throughout my career.\n\nEver since I was a child I had very different opinions about the world and our role in it. In school I wasn't very popular with the teachers, because I dared to think for myself and refused to go with \"this is how things are done around here\".\n\nAs years went by I got more and more confidence about my ideas. I saw that they work. I was able to start a successful career in IT in under a year and earn enough to travel the world, learn and enjoy.\n\nEventually as I got more mature, travelling and enjoying decreased in importance for me and I started to desire to use my experience\n\n\n\nStill, ever since I switched to English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ as my main language, my writing never felt as refined as I was used to.\n\nThen I added Spanish into the mix, which after I moved to Mexico ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ came to be the language I speak the most and so my attention has been diluted even further.\n\nAnd to complicate things more, I realized that speaking my very own mother tongue, Czech ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿, actually doesn't come out as fluid and natural as it used to either.\n\nSo here I have it. Jack of all trades, master of none.\n\nI hope to improve that by writing regularly.","lang":"en","translations":{"es":"hola-a-todos"},"tags":[]}
