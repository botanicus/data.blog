Fortunately in Mexico it's possible to live with that, but we're really talking bare bones.\n\nAnd frankly I don't mind. I never cared for luxury. I enjoyed it when I had it, now I don't and I'm just as happy as I was before. Or more, since I don't have to work in a career that I didn't like all that much.\n\nI'm staying in a hostel for $4 a night, most of my meals that I cook costs some $2 each, so there's no problem whatsoever.\n\n## Helping my local community\n\nWith more free time on my hands, I decided to reach out to some parishes and ask whether I can be of help. I'm not religious, I have a pretty bad oppinion about Catholicism, but I don't consider it a problem: I'm trying to look for church organisers who I can work with, more open-minded types.\n\nI'm happy to work with anyone whom I can respect and who can respect me, simple as that.\n\nI'm hoping to be able to do some free/for donation counselling as a preparation for my second career, as well as to learn about the communities.\n\n## Coronavirus\n\nWhen the pandemic started to arrive to Mexico, I was just in Zipolite, Oaxaca. It's a small town with beautiful beaches, great food and very open-minded community of artisans and travellers.\n\nI was due to return to Mexico City, but I decided that staying where I am is a safer option. I'm not so much afraid of the virus, but who knows what will happen in terms of food supplies, food prices and violence. Better to stay on the seashore.\n\nFor me it's quite exciting not knowing what's going to happen. I don't care to know. I like the surprise.\n\nThe most interesting are the various attitudes of people.\n\nThere are some that are constantly glued to the media, talking about the topic constantly and being stressed out.\n\nSome others don't believe in the virus exists or that it's such a big deal, saying that it's lobby against China and I don't know what more.\n\nPersonally I believe that there's such virus and that it's a big mess, but that worrying won't help anyone. I'm happy, enjoying the beach, staying active, eating well and being fine with whatever's to come.\n\n## Living on the tropic coast\n\nLiving on the coast is amazing. It's warm all the time, some 30â€“32 C during the day and about 24 C during the night. I go to the beach all the time, to have a little swim, to chill in the sun, talk to friends over a few beers ...\n\nIt's much easier to keep calm, not to stress out and be really connected to oneself, living from that place most of the time, staying mindful, not being reactive.\n\nThe one thing that's hard to do, especially living in a hostel is to get anything done. I don't have many things that would need to get done these days, but there are some.\n\nFirst world problems ðŸ™‚","lang":"en","translations":{"es":"actualizacion-de-marzo-2020"},"tags":[{"name":"now","slug":"now","path":"/tags/now.json"},{"name":"coronavirus","slug":"coronavirus","path":"/tags/coronavirus.json"},{"name":"budget-living","slug":"budget-living","path":"/tags/budget-living.json"},{"name":"volunteering","slug":"volunteering","path":"/tags/volunteering.json"}]}
