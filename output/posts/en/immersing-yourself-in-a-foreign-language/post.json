Today I want to elaborate more on the most important thing of all: how to immerse yourself in a foreign language environment._\n\nI'll return shortly to goals with a question: how important is learning the language for you?\n\nWith a reminder, that if you don't have a good reason, you're probably not going to make it, because it is a lot of hard work, I can promise you that.\n\nSo anything vague as impressing your friends, looking smart and in many cases curiosity is just not enough.\n\nIf you have a good reason, it's nearly certain that you have a real connection to the cultre in one way or the other or you're seriously planning to have.\n\nSuch as _\"I'm want to marry this peruvian girl, I want to be able to speak her language.\"_ or _\"I love Latin America, I want to move and live here\"_. These are good reasons.\n\nEvery time when I succeeded in learning a language, I had a reason like that.\n\n- **English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§:** I wanted to be able to live and work in the UK.\n- **Spanish ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸:** I got really into Spanish, and later into Latin culture. I love the people and I eventually ended up living in Spain and later traveling throughout Latin America and living here.\n- **Polish ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±:** I lived in Poland and I was fascinated by a language familiar to my own (Czech ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿).\n\nEvery time when I didn't, my reason was too shallow.\n\n- **French** at school: just to survive the damn thing.\n- **Chinese:** I had a Chinese girlfriend, and I love many aspects of one of the most incredible cultures that ever occupied space on this planet, but living in London, I never got immersed into the culture and the language. I was just curious, nothing else.\n\n_So let's be clear, this is the one thing that determines your success in learning a language._\n\nNow the good news: immersing yourself into a language is incredibly simple.\n\nYou just get more friends who speak the language and you speak them only in that language, you read in that language and so on.\n\nNot a rocket science, right?\n\nWell, I know, _except you don't speak the language yet_.\n\nOnce you can make even basic conversation, it's easy to progress.\n\nBut before that, it's really a catch-22 situation.\n\n_\"It's extremely hard to learn more, because you don't know enough to even start.\"_\n\nTo that I say you need to make _not_ learning the language _not_ an option.\n\nWhen I lived in Spain, I learned daily situations pretty quickly, but before the huge gap between these situations and real conversational fluency coupled with the fact, that I didn't really need to speak Spanish much, as I had mostly international friends in Barcelona, I just didn't bother to progress further.\n\nWhen I got to BogotÃ¡ and realized that English is just not on the menu here, things changed. Especially as I have only 1 non-latino friend in BogotÃ¡.\n\nIt's common sense, but this is the one thing that is likely to make or break your learning experience.\n\nBecause how can you get from the catch-22?\n\nWell, there's no clean way really. You have to start somehow, trying to speak, when knowing nothing, trying to watch a TV show, trying to read a newspaper.\n\nDoesn't matter all that much, just start.\n\nJust be mindful of learning the language you need. And more often than not, that is the spoken one, not the one from books: you'll get there, but mind you, you don't want to start there unless your actual goal is to read books in that language.\n\n## Tactics\n\n_This section is not nearly as important as the one above. You really need to know why you're trying to learn that language and put yourself in a situation, that failing is not an option. But with that said, here are some things you can try._\n\n### Getting yourself into real conversations with natives and language learners\n\nThere are **language exchange groups** all over the world and they are helpful to start.\n\nIf you're really in the very beginnings, you'll benefit more from talking to other language learners who talk your native language.\n\nOnce you get better, you'll benefit more from talking to the natives in the group.\n\nAnd they are usually both natives and language learners in any of the exchange groups. It's a great place to start!\n\n### Getting a foreign partner\n\nSo as much as I don't recommend getting a partner _just_ because they speak the language you are learning, and I wouldn't recommend having it as a goal; if it happens ... it can help a lot.\n\n_But ... if they speak your language and you're only beginning to speak theirs, you're probably going to do the easy thing._\n\nSo having a foreign partner will not help you much unless you are talking with them in their language.\n\n_Between these first two categories, getting into real conversations and having a foreign partner, I learned most in any language I speak._\n\n_So that's what I recommend. But here are some others in case you're in a situation when these are hard to achieve:_\n\n### TV shows and radio\n\nTV shows and radio have real-world conversations that use real-world language and real-world topics. And you can watch one that you already know, so even if you're just in the beginning, you'll be able to understand what's going on and learn in the process.\n\n### Newspapers and news\n\nUnless your language learning goal has something to do with politics, I would not recommend starting here. You might want to do it later, but in the beginning, the language and topics will likely be too difficult for you.\n\n### Books\n\nBooks can be useful if you don't mind reading very primitive ones for children. They might give you an idea about the basic language, but they won't give you the real-world vocabulary you need.\n\nSo personally I don't consider it a good option.\n\nAnd if you want to read the _real stuff_, then ... seriously, wait. Look, even the _Little prince_ by ExupÃ©ry is a non-trivial read if you are new to the language and contains grammar that you don't need in the beginning and will only confuse you.","lang":"en","translations":[],"tags":[{"name":"language learning","slug":"language-learning","path":"/tags/language-learning.json"}]}
