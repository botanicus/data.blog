Gmail has this lovely feature that allows you to add `+anything` after your username and it will still get delivered to your inbox. And with Gmail filters, you can execute actions over matching emails, such as marking them as read and skipping the inbox.\n\n_Wait, what?_\n\nFor instance if you're `joe@gmail.com`, you can also use `joe+newsletter@gmail.com`, `joe+notifications@gmail.com`, `joe+orders@gmail.com` and so on.\n\nIn my case, _I give my default email (one without `+whatever`) only to people, not to machines_.\n\nSo if I register for any app or online service, I'd always use `me+service@gmail.com` and then in [Gmail filters](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/filters) I'd use this:\n\n![gmail-filter-service.jpg](manejando-correo-electronico-con-calma/gmail-filter-service.jpg)\n\nYeah, it's in Spanish ... it says skip the inbox, mark as read and apply the `service` label (so I can easily see all these service emails).","lang":"es","translations":[],"tags":[{"name":"Gmail","slug":"gmail","path":"/tags/gmail.json"},{"name":"correo electrónico","slug":"correo-electronico","path":"/tags/correo-electronico.json"}]}
