I always welcome feedback and contributions. This short post explains how to do it.","body":"If you ever contributed to any OSS, you already know the drill: fork the [repo](https://github.com/botanicus/data.blog), make changes, run tests and submit a pull request.\n\n## Which file to edit?\n\nFirstly, do not touch anything in `output/`. That's all generated.\n\nWhat you're looking for is in `posts/:slug/`. That directory contains all the sources for a post, with the post itself being named `post.md` and the rest being images and external files.\n\n## How to edit it?\n\nThe general format is:\n\n```\nYAML header\n---\nmarkdown content\n```\n\nGenerally you probably shouldn't need to touch the YAML header.\n\nWhen it comes to the content itself, there are few caveats:\n\n- There must be exactly 1 `h1`-level heading. That's the main post title.\n- Directly after there has to be excerpt. Excerpt is a paragraph of text wrapped by `_`.\n\nSo the minimal content looks like this:\n\n```md\n# Hello world!\n\n_This is the first post that says hello world!_\n```\n\nThis structure is already there with all my published posts. Your only job is not to break it :smile:\n\n[Format reference](https://github.com/botanicus/blog-generator.js)\n\n## How to test it?\n\nJust enable Travis CI to run on your fork.\n\nAlternatively you can run whatever is in the `script` section of [.travis.yml](https://github.com/botanicus/data.blog/blob/master/.travis.yml).\n\n## And then?\n\nWell, submit a pull request of course!\n\nI promise to seriously consider all the contributions.\n\nHappy coding!","lang":"es","tags":[{"name":"mi motor de blog","slug":"mi-motor-de-blog","path":"/tags/mi-motor-de-blog.json"},{"name":"c√≥digo abierto","slug":"codigo-abierto","path":"/tags/codigo-abierto.json"}]}
