I'm planning a retreat to relax and recover and to do some traveling.","body":"## Work <i class=\"hashtag\">IT</i>\n\nI had plenty of work the past 2 months. It's a project in Ruby on Rails, React and Draft.js.\n\nI'm the only developer on the project and it's fun, but equally it's exhausting.\n\nI spent some 3 weeks writing a rich text editor in Draft.js. Draft.js is a framework for writing rich text editors and just as React.js, it came from Facebook.\n\nIt's really cool and there was never such an easy way to write a rich text editor. Those who had to customize TinyMCE know what I mean.\n\nBut that doesn't mean it's easy, especially as the Draft.js ecosystem is nowhere near as mature as for instance the React.js ecosystem.\n\n## Partial migration from Things to Reminders <i class=\"hashtag\">IT</i>\n\nThings are the best GTD client out there for iOS, no comparison.\n\nHowever they have 2 really big problems: the Shortcuts integration is limited and there is no collaboration.\n\nTo the first, for instance with Reminders it's possible to run a shortcut that displays a dialog with a selection from the tasks, I select which I'm working on and then it gets logged into a calendar for instance. Useful for Pomodoro. Things cannot do it.\n\nStill, that's not the worst. Lack of collaboration is much worse.\n\nI have 2 iPads: one that I use for work-related stuff. It's 12.9\" and I don't carry it around. Then other one is the older 10.5\" and I use it for my personal stuff. I do carry it around.\n\nThese iPads have a different purpose and in Things I have tasks that are specific to that purpose.\n\nHowever there are projects that are relevant to me personally as well as to my work.\n\nFor instance working on OSS. I do it, because I enjoy it, but at the same time it gives me more credibility.\n\nSo I might work on it in different contexts from either of my iPads.\n\nAnd since there's no sharing in Things, I migrated these tasks that are relevant to both contexts to Reminders and I share them across both machines.\n\nI have to say Reminders are nowhere near where Things, nowhere near at all, but having all the relevant tasks at hand is more important than anything else.\n\n## Discovering my <i class=\"hashtag\">spirituality</i>\n\nI was always quite a spiritual person (not in the organized religion sense, rather I believe spirituality is path unique to each person). I've been a regular meditator for the past 6 years and early this year I started to do reiki.\n\nWith that said, many things happened in the past 2 months and I found myself immersed deeply in things I always believed in, but didn't know I have anything to do with.\n\nI found that my 2 very close friends have a lot to do with this, but they just choose not to talk about it too publicly, so knowing them for as long as I do, only now I discovered there's a whole new layer of them that I haven't encountered before and one that's crucial to their identity and values in the world.\n\nThere's been many up and downs, more ups than downs, but the downs also came and were quite scary.\n\nAnyway there's always been something crucial that was missing to my life, I knew it, but didn't know what it was. Now I know and I'm going to dedicate a lot more time to this in the future.\n\n## Planning to rest and travel  <i class=\"hashtag\">health</i>\n\nI've been in the city four months and I really need a break in a quiet environment.\n\nI booked a flight to my secret destination in Caribbean and I'm going to spend at least 10 days there, just swimming, diving, eating octopus, meditating and writing.\n\nGiven that it's a village of 1000 people with only 1 bar that's usually empty, it's the only thing one can do there – and thanks God for that.","lang":"es","translations":{"en":"september-2019-update"},"tags":[{"name":"now","slug":"now","path":"/tags/now.json"},{"name":"Ruby on Rails","slug":"ruby-on-rails","path":"/tags/ruby-on-rails.json"},{"name":"React.js","slug":"react.js","path":"/tags/react.js.json"},{"name":"Draft.js","slug":"draft.js","path":"/tags/draft.js.json"},{"name":"spirituality","slug":"spirituality","path":"/tags/spirituality.json"},{"name":"retreat","slug":"retreat","path":"/tags/retreat.json"}]}
