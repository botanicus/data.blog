So after an incident involving sea water, which rendered my phone unusable, I decided I wouldn't bother buying a new one. One month later an I don't miss the bloody thing in the least.","body":"# Sin celular ... de nuevo\n\n\nI like to swim in the sea. Turns out that my phone didn't. I had it in a case that was waterproof – or so I thought. It was a very cheap Huawei, so whatever.\n\nBeing under the impression that I \"need\" a phone, I started to investigate what my options are. I always buy cheap phones, but given my admiration for Apple products, I decided I'd take a peak.\n\nI went to an Apple Store, and quite frankly, I was not impressed by what I saw even the slightest bit. So let me be frank here:\n\n> Dear Apple, if you think I lost my mind to pay money that would buy me a good new notebook for a thing that serves to send texts (which I never do), make calls (which I never do), read maps and allow me to be available on WhatsApp and Messenger, then I assure you I have not.\n\n> Great that it's got 50 cameras and it can send messages to Mars, wipe my arse and splash the toilet and feed my (ilusionary) cat, I just don't care.\n\nAnd since I'm well going with my rant, what's the deal with these big phones? Steve Jobs used to laugh at the idea and I was always of the same belief.\n\n> I don't want a bloody brick in my pocket.\n\n---\n\nWell, never mind then. I have an iPad. Yes, it's big, but I have a very small shoulder bag for it, I don't even feel it. And given that I carry it around most of the time already, as I use it to read and write, why not?\n\nFor a long time I found having a phone redundant when I have an iPad.\n\nAnd if I'm to choose, iPad wins every single time. The main reason? SmartKeyboard and Apple Pencil, which are both vital for me. And even without those, I just like iPad more.\n\nIt'd be quite perfect, unfortunately my iPad is the WiFi version. Next time I'm sure to buy the celular version, but for the time being it's good enough.\n\nOne issue is that it's impossible to install **WhatsApp** on an iPad without some serious hacking. But ... pretty much everyone has Messenger and that works on an iPad easy peasy.\n\nThere's one person that I communicate with on a fairly regular basis that has only WhatsApp. So my sister re-sends her my messages.\n\nI also admit that an iPad is not the most convenient device to read a **map**. Does it matter? I still use it like that. And funny enough, my navigation sense improved a lot, because in effect, I'm more mindful of the route, because it's a hassle trying to navigate with an iPad.","lang":"es","translations":{"en":"without-a-phone-again"},"tags":[{"name":"minimalismo","slug":"minimalismo","path":"/tags/minimalismo.json"},{"name":"vida sin tecnología","slug":"vida-sin-tecnologia","path":"/tags/vida-sin-tecnologia.json"}]}
