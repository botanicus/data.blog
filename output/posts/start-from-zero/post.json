This is by no means intuitive. Let's dig into how to do that.","body":"It's so easy to be distracted these days. Work, traffic, hobbies, kids, social networks, email, never in history there have been so many information around.\n\nWhen is the last time someone _really listened_ to you? Seeing groups of people having lunch, all of them on their phone, this simple skill is becoming scarce.\n\nAnd since _being there with someone_, giving your full attention, _giving our companion_ is one of the most valuable things in life, this should give you an idea in how terrible shape our society is these days.\n\nIt's commonplace seeing parents with their kids, parents sucked into their screens and kids as well. What a childhood are these poor kids having.\n\nAnyway, just as too much information is distractive to our relationships, it's distractive to our accomplishments. And this is where goals come from: it's a way of striving in an _autopilot age_.\n\nBut it's grossly mislead and goals are just not the way to go, as I said in my last post [meaning over goals](/posts/meaning-over-goals).\n\nI finished the article saying that we should _just flow_ – but how?\n\n## Clear your plate first\n\nIf you ate so much cake you're sick, maybe ... eat less cake?\n\nWhat matters to you in your life? Sure, reading FB can be fun, but then are you having time to _do_ the things that you really want to do, that are important to you, what you want to be your contribution to the humanity?\n\n_Getting all absorbed in consumption means we've got no time left for to create._\n\nIt's easy to say _\"oh, I'm just reading FB now, but I'll get to it in a bit\"_. Of course no one believes that.\n\nSo ... are you gonna make yourself useful or what?\n\nI strongly recommend adhering to your own version of [digital minimalism](/posts/digital-minimalism), removing all the distractions, so you can concentrate on what really matters.\n\nPersonally I even [ditched FB](/posts/bye-bye-facebook) and I don't regret it at all, in fact I'd definitely recommend it, but of course that might be too much for many people.\n\n## Taking care of yourself <i class=\"hashtag\">meditation</i> <i class=\"hashtag\">exercise</i>\n\nGoals and deadlines have the advantage that they work to a decent degree even on autopilot. The flow state, when things just happen and we don't even know how, is much more enjoyable, but it's a lot more fragile.\n\nFirst of all, _keep watching where are you wasting your time_ and remove it from your life. Delete the app, block the website, do what you have to do to make it go away.\n\nSecond, how do you take care of your body and mind? I say body and mind, because they are connected. If you're not _meditating_ yet, I suggest you start! _Exercise_, in whatever form you find enjoyable, at least on a semi-regular basis is also important.\n\n## Time allocation\n\nSince you removed all the distractions, now it shouldn't be so hard to implement the right schedule to allow you to flow.\n\nThis shouldn't be anything too rigid and certainly shouldn't be forced, as flow works, _because we <u>want to</u> do something_. If you don't feel like doing it today, give it a miss.\n\nHell, it might be even useful to do absolutely nothing for a few days, and see what you end up wanting to do – speaking of productive activities, not browsing FB.\n\n**This is the important bit: start from emptiness, from zero. Drop the expectations. Start from boredom, and gradually add up things that connects to your purpose.**\n\nAnd if there's something you feel like you need to do, but you never feel like doing it – do you _really_ have to do it?\n\n## Being asynchronous\n\nIt's important to have \"inbox\" systems for clearing your brain.\n\nSay you're in the state of flow, and suddenly you remember something really important to do. You need to be able to put that task in a system, and being able to forget about it for the moment, having the confidence, that it's been logged and you'll pick it up later.\n\nSame goes for articles. In the flow state, you often need to look something up online. Sometimes you find articles, that you'd really like to read. And, if you don't have a system to catalog them for reading them later, well, you might end up reading them and getting off track.","lang":"en","translations":{},"tags":[{"name":"flow","slug":"flow","path":"/tags/flow.json"},{"name":"mindfulness","slug":"mindfulness","path":"/tags/mindfulness.json"}]}
