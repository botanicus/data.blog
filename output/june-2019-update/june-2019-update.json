I'm looking for contract programming work. I'm experimenting with Oura ring to improve my sleep and I'm trying to live healthier.","body":"## This blog *<span style=\"color: gray\">#IT</span>*\n\nI have a lot of work launching this blog. For that purpose I wrote:\n\n- A [blog front-end engine][gh-blog-engine] in React.js.\n- A [blog content compiler][gh-blog-generator] that allows me to write posts in markdown format and returns JSON files that then the front-end engine consumes.\n- Repozitory with [my blog posts][gh-data-blog] that includes both the markdown posts I've written and the generated JSON files. The JSON files get compiled on Travis CI.\n<!-- TODO: the runner to take it from Dropbox once I have a URL. -->\n\n_All of these projects are available as open-source software, free for anyone to use. Visit the links the see the project pages on GitHub._\n\n## Looking for freelance work *<span style=\"color: gray\">#IT</span>*\n\nI left TopTal after 5 years due to being disatisfied with the changes in there in the last 2 years.\n\nBecause of that, I'm on a look out for freelance work. Anything in **Ruby**, **Ruby on Rails**, **JavaScript** and **React.js**.\n\nIf you might be interested, please check my [about page](/about).\n\n## Oura ring *<span style=\"color: gray\">#health #tracking</span>*\n\nAs an ongoing effort to live healthier, I got the [Oura ring][oura-ring] tracker to track my sleep and activity.\n\nIt also tracks naps (automatically) and meditation.\n\nBeing a diehard minimalist, I was very hesitant to get anything I'd have to wear on my body, but ring is something even I can accept.\n\nThe data seems to be useful, but I'm still in the testing phase, so the judge is still out.\n\n## Health\n\n- I **meditate** most of the days. I generally aim for 1 hour and I stick with it most of the time. I've been using the brilliant [LifeFlow brain synchronization][lifeflow] tracks for a good while now. I found them to have a noticeable effect on the quality of the meditation sessions.\n- Oura ring has been nagging me to do more exercise, so I'm **jogging more frequently** now.\n- After spending a month in Europe, where every meal comes with either potatoes or bread, I started to prepare **salad** for me most of the days. Now, even when I'm back to Mexico, where the food is much more fresh and healthy, I still keep eating salad most of the days.\n\n# Change of life values\n\nAfter being enlightened by a divine influence, I came to reevaluate my direction and values. During my 20s, I was always ready to party and my priorities were a lot about having fun, doing stupid things and traveling.\n\nMany times it was great and many times it wasn't. It was necessary and I learned a lot. Now passing to my 30s, I feel ready to turn the page and concentrate on more lasting things.\n\n\n[gh-blog-engine]: https://github.com/botanicus/blog\n[gh-blog-generator]: https://github.com/botanicus/blog-generator.js\n[gh-data-blog]: https://github.com/botanicus/data.blog\n[oura-ring]: https://ouraring.com/\n[lifeflow]: https://www.project-meditation.org","tags":[{"name":"now","slug":"now","path":"/tags/now.json"},{"name":"Oura ring","slug":"oura-ring","path":"/tags/oura-ring.json"},{"name":"health","slug":"health","path":"/tags/health.json"},{"name":"my blog engine","slug":"my-blog-engine","path":"/tags/my-blog-engine.json"},{"name":"OSS","slug":"oss","path":"/tags/oss.json"},{"name":"life values","slug":"life-values","path":"/tags/life-values.json"}]}
