So far July has been tough, but despite everything, I'm managing quite OK.","body":"## Experimenting with iPadOS <i class=\"hashtag\">IT</i>\n\nAs a passionate iPad Pro user, I got the beta version of iPadOS and I started to use it.\n\nThere's a lot of good stuff already: better multitasking, Safari identifies itself as the desktop one, there are some great gestures for text selection and manipulation, widgets are on the home screen, dark mode is built-in and so on.\n\nBut more than anything, I see it as a mindset shift.\n\nUntil now the few of us who were already full-timing on iPad were looked upon as eccentrics.\n\nNow what we have seen there all along is becoming an inescapable reality.\n\n_If you want to try iPadOS, keep in mind the word \"beta\". I haven't have many issues at all, except of one, but that one was pretty bad: the iPad frozen, not even hard reset worked and I had to wait for the battery to run out._\n\n## Starting a new freelance project  <i class=\"hashtag\">IT</i>\n\nThis one is really cool and I wish I could have shared it here, but as it hasn't been launched yet, all the details are confidential.\n\n_Anyway it's supposed to be a short one, so if you're interested in my services, don't hesitate to contact me._\n\n## This blog <i class=\"hashtag\">IT</i>\n\nI made many improvements to the [blog front-end][gh-blog] and I wrote [Dropbox blog publisher][gh-dropbox-blog-publisher].\n\nThat means that I can just drop any blog post in markdown to a special drop folder in my Dropbox, the publisher picks it up and publishes it here.\n\nIt also watches for changes to any existing posts and uploads any changes as well.\n\nI'm really happy with that and at some point I'm going to post about my blogging workflow.\n\n## Health and life\n\nSo far July hasn't been an easy month. I managed to eat pretty well, but I haven't done a lot of meditation this month and my sleep have been pretty weak lately as well.\n\n\n[gh-blog]: https://github.com/botanicus/blog\n[gh-dropbox-blog-publisher]: https://github.com/botanicus/runners/tree/master/dropbox-blog-publisher","tags":[{"name":"now","slug":"now","path":"/tags/now.json"},{"name":"iPadOS","slug":"ipados","path":"/tags/ipados.json"},{"name":"my blog engine","slug":"my-blog-engine","path":"/tags/my-blog-engine.json"}]}
